AD;Costa and 48 MEPs call for a ceasefire in Nagorno-Karabakh;"The president of the parliamentary group of Liberals of Andorra, Ferran Costa, has denounced through social media the situation that is being lived in Upper Karabakh, a region located between Azerbaijan and Armenia that is in conflict · Lic. Costa called for a ceasefire and called for compliance with international humanitarian law and the protection of civilians. This denunciation is in addition to the one that 48 MEPs have called on the Vice-President of the European Commission, Josep Borrell, for the EU to take ""immediate"" action to end this war. MEPs have called for action to be taken to prevent possible interventions in the conflict by third countries, such as Turkey, as they say this would ""quickly worsen the situation with unpredictable consequences for the whole region"".";E
AD;Nagorno-Karabakh, on the brink of the abyss;"At first glance, there are nothing but craters and ruins in Sushi, all under a smokescreen rising from a nearby forest. The fire is said to have been caused by a phosphorus bombing on Friday. The video images taken then point in this direction.On September 27, Azerbaijan launched an offensive to end the longest-running conflict in the former Soviet Union. Its collapse unfolded a rosary of conflicts, from Moldova to Tajikistan, and since then Nagorno-Karabakh has been a cartographic anomaly, a predominantly Armenian mountainous enclave in Azerbaijani territory. This sparked a war (in the early 1990s) that was won by Armenians and forced the displacement of more than half a million Azerbaijanis. Three decades later, the latter seem determined to return, stay and, of course, expel the former winners. And Sushi (Susha, for Azerbaijanis) is key in this war. From here you can bomb Stepanakert, the capital of the enclave, and also cut off the road that connects it with Armenia. It is the true umbilical cord on which Karabakh depends.We are still looking for life in Sushi when suddenly a woman sticks her head out of the balcony of a seemingly dilapidated building. She says she is about to leave, they have just called her to evacuate her, but she invites us up and has a coffee.""This is my brother's flat. I had a beautiful farm and house, but the bombs ended up destroying them, ”he says, in a conversation constantly interrupted by the phone. Her family is waiting for her in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, but Zoya does not want to leave. The youngest of his three children is at the front and could never return. Are you right: how can the Armenian infantry cope with a drone-managed rain of fire? These are the rules of the game for over a month now.From Zoya’s brother’s balcony you can see Stepanakert in the valley and the historic Sushi Ghazanchetsots Church. It was bombed on October 7. Zoya says most of her neighbors fled then. Fortunately, no children were left here when the bombs hit the school a few days later, nor was anyone at the cultural center bombed on Thursday. We saw the rows of red armchairs, today covered in dust and lined up under an open canal roof.The excuse for Azerbaijanis to bomb hospitals (the last was Stepanakert's maternity ward on Thursday), shopping malls and other civilian targets is for their rival to raise military targets alongside them. We haven't seen any of this.Thirty years of conflict""It's genocide, that's all,"" says Zoya, before recapping the story that dragged her to this corner of the Caucasus. He was 28 years old when he arrived from Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, in 1988, the year the Armenians of Sumgayit (a city bordering Baku) suffered a pogrom that historians say was the spark that it ignited the war of the 1990s. Zoya recalls arriving in Yerevan on December 6, 1988, just on the eve of the earthquake that killed dozens of Armenians. He arrived here still in shock from the hasty flight, crossing a land that was literally shaking beneath his feet. In Sushi there was a place to stay, because the Azerbaijanis, who were mostly in the city at the time, also ran for their lives, but in the opposite direction. Population exchanges have since been painfully chained between the two former Soviet republics, and after centuries of peaceful coexistence, it is almost impossible to find Azerbaijanis in Armenia or Armenians in Azerbaijan.The war continues. There is talk of ""hundreds"" of civilians killed, but the numbers always dance to the sound of propaganda. Foreign ministers from both countries met in Geneva on Friday, and while both sides pledged to avoid civilian targets, the meeting did nothing but certify what several analysts already take for granted: while Armenia expects a ceasefire, Azerbaijan only seeks victory. He is flanked by a Turkey today embarked on an aggressive foreign policy that strikes from Libya to this corner of the Caucasus, through Syria.After asking for help from Russia, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan received a response from Moscow yesterday: ""The necessary assistance"" will be provided if fighting between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces in Karabakh spread to Armenian territory. In Stepanakert, Artak Beglaryan, the Ombudsman of Karabakh, speaks of a ""humanitarian catastrophe.""""They have control of the air given to them by their technology and the support of Erdogan [the Turkish president]. The international community also has mechanisms to stop this, but it does nothing, ”said the 32-year-old Karabakh, who was left blind by a landmine when he was 6. The war not only does not end, but it is increasingly more to remember when it started.";E
AD;The war is over but Armenia is approaching the abyss;"Miatsum, miatsum! (Drive, drive!), Hundreds of people shout in front of the Armenian government headquarters in Yerevan, the capital. It was early yesterday morning when a post by Nikol Paixinian, the Armenian prime minister, on his Facebook account pushed a wave of people into the streets, enraged and disappointed. After six weeks of trying to deal with the attacks of the Azerbaijani army on the Nagorno-Karabakh region, Armenia finally showed the flag of surrender. ""It is a difficult and incredibly painful decision,"" the president apologized for the document he had signed with the Azerbaijani president and also with the Russian, Vladimir Putin, the day before at noon. The agreed end of hostilities - in which Putin has played a key role - benefits the interests of Azerbaijan, which has taken control of part of the region since the escalation of the conflict on September 27. past. Some privileges that he will keep.“Why am I here now? Are you kidding me? ”Replies an offended Armenian in his 50s. Beside him, a 32-year-old computer scientist apologizes. The Vahak - it is said - explains that everyone is very nervous, that no one expected ""a similar act of betrayal."" ""They spent six weeks telling us lies, making sure everything was going well [at the front], that they were regaining control of the situation. How do they want us to take it? ”He adds.And he is right. After a ten-day coverage of Nagorno-Karabakh at war, ARA has been able to verify that press releases on the situation at the front contrasted with what this reporter has seen on the ground. “There have been numerous casualties among the enemy ranks and the morale of our soldiers is high,” said the latest paper, dated Monday, November 9, just hours before Paixinian’s faltering. Just an hour after the prime minister's message, the first protesters began to break the windows of the government headquarters, throwing stones or any equally blunt object. Three protesters then managed to enter the building and opened the door. The result? The crowd entered the headquarters.It has been an assault ""in Armenia,"" in an almost orderly and unhurried manner, like one walking through a museum. Anna, a 24-year-old girl, was studying and working in Germany when she launched the Azerbaijan offensive, which claims the territories that Armenia occupied during the 1994 war. This generation, she says, was born in 2000. in 2001, in 2002 ..., ""thousands have died for nothing!"". The death toll ranges from the one thousand casualties recognized by Armenians to the more than 5,000 total recorded from Moscow.After a moment of tension caused by a collective reprimand against a teenager who has ripped a painting off the wall, most conclude that there is nothing left to do there. His steps now lead to Parliament, about a twenty minute walk away. This reporter comes across Neil Hauer, a Canadian analyst and Caucasian expert based in Tbilisi for three years. Let us review the controversial agreement that has infuriated an important part of the Armenians: a ceasefire has been agreed between the two sides, the exchange of prisoners, the gradual return of the seven adjacent and Azeri-majority districts until the war of the 1990s. including the city of Sushi, taken a few days ago by enemy troops - as well as the deployment of Russian peacekeepers and the re-establishment of the road connecting the enclave with Armenia.""It's the best deal the Armenians could aspire to given the speed with which they were losing the war to a much more powerful army. However, we still don't know what the final status of Karabakh will be,"" says Hauer, now facing. of an increasingly full staircase of Parliament. In fact, the agreement was reached after the Azerbaijani army regained control of Sushi, the second largest city in the region, and set out to storm the capital, Stepanakert, just 11 kilometers away.Meanwhile, the crowd also takes the interior of the Armenian Parliament. “We will kill the traitor of Paixinian!” Someone shouts with a cigar in his hand from the grandstand of the chamber. Protesters also manage to enter the offices, where they force drawers and cupboards. And they take everything they find: a coffee pot, a leather jacket ... everything is worth it, also a ball that a boy has rescued from a bin. It is the beginning of a new era.";N

AD;Escape from a Nagorno-Karabakh that bleeds for war;"When refugees are spoken of in Nagorno-Karabakh, it is usually done in feminine. Thousands of women are fleeing every day from villages near the battlefield, where Azerbaijan is targeting and bombing civilian locations day after day. The men, on the other hand, are in charge of grabbing the rifle and waiting in the trench. Adult men, but also young men who, in many cases, barely reach adulthood. The war between Armenia and Azerbaijan over this divided region - according to the map within the domains of Azerbaijan but with an Armenian majority - has not stopped and the conflict has been entrenched for days since the fighting began on September 27. .""They are very discouraged,"" a military official said quietly in Stepanakert, the capital of the unrecognized Artsakh republic, referring to his soldiers, who have suffered airstrikes from a homeless hole. A few days ago, a surgeon at the hospital in this city assured this journalist that he had never seen anything like it in his entire professional career and despite Nagorno-Karabakh having suffered two wars in the last 30 years. “People with mutilated limbs come to us,” he explained.Meanwhile, they, the refugees, have had to carry their children on their shoulders and go down to the Armenian capital, Yerevan, to escape the attacks. There, they wait for the phone to ring to hear the voice, for a few seconds, of their relatives at the front. ""We try to talk to them every day, but we don't even want to know where they are, just by hearing their voice we already know that they are alive and let them continue with their mission,"" says Neli, a school teacher who fled. from his village on September 27, when the first projectiles fell on Nagorno-Karabakh. But he smiles and is optimistic: ""At least here I teach them all the subjects and the neighborhood school will admit them right away.""From an abandoned restaurant in Abovyan, 15 kilometers from Yerevan, she and several women of all ages wait for the war to end. ""On the first day of the offensive we were left alone, all the men marched to the front. We decided to hide in a church, but they started bombing very close. The children kept crying, ""he laments. He also explains that they then went to Stepanakert by bus, but the artillery fell on them. It is not the only story that shows indiscriminate attacks on the civilian population.Nazani, 26, gives a similar testimony. ""I remember it was Sunday morning and bombs started falling. I took my two children and we hid in the woods because the artillery hit civilian locations. Her husband is also at the front and she takes care of the creatures. ""It was impossible to spend the day locked in shelters,"" he says, referring to the state in which they had to live in Stepanakert to protect themselves from attacks. So he joined the convoy of cars made up of volunteers who evacuate dozens of people every day who want to get to Yerevan and other cities in the country.And it is this same volunteering that predominates right now in the lands of Nagorno-Karabakh: ""Here the prices have not been inflated by the war, they have disappeared, everything is free,"" said Hobit, one of the few men who is not at the front. ""I'm too old, they didn't want me, but in 2016 I did. Now I have decided to help in the best way I can: distributing food to all the shelters in Stepanakert ”.No agreementRussia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that the Kremlin wants to place Russian military observers on the Nagorno-Karabakh battle front to ensure a fully utopian ceasefire agreed on paper a week ago. . Russia argues that the final decision rests with Armenia and Azerbaijan. And so far, neither side has respected it and civilian casualties have continued to rise. Both parties are accused of breaching the agreement.The figures are staggering: the death toll on the Armenian side is more than 500, although corpses abandoned at the front due to unstoppable fighting have not yet been collected. Therefore, the number of fallen Armenian soldiers - it is speculated - would be much higher. Azerbaijan, on the other hand, does not give figures for military casualties.";E
AT;Armenia and Azerbaijan at war;"Despite international calls for restraint, the fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed Karabakh region continues. According to their defense ministries, both sides shot each other with heavy artillery fire on Monday night. Azerbaijan ordered a partial mobilization of the population, Armenia had already done this on Sunday for all male citizens. In addition, both countries have imposed martial law.

Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke on the phone with the Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan. He called on the international community to prevent Turkey from interfering in the conflict.Both parties to the conflict have accused each other of being responsible for the escalation. Azerbaijan said that Armenia had fired at Nagorno-Karabakh from the air and with artillery. The own troops then destroyed three tanks on the opposing side and shot down two helicopters and three drones. Azerbaijan disagreed, saying it responded to an Armenian attack.Long conflictSince the collapse of the Soviet Union, Armenia and Azerbaijan have been arguing over the belonging of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is mainly inhabited by Armenians and which separated from Azerbaijan in 1991. The West and the countries in the region are concerned about the conflict, as it threatens to destabilize the South Caucasus. Important oil and gas pipelines run there. Although the predominantly Christian Armenia and the predominantly Muslim Azerbaijan signed a ceasefire in 1994, both sides regularly accuse each other of attacks around Nagorno Karabakh and along the common border.

The agreement was signed by Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia - Turkey's role is not explicitly mentioned in the written agreement.However, Turkey, which is assisting Azerbaijan in the conflict, expects to be involved in monitoring the agreement and refers to an agreement reached on Wednesday by defense ministers on both sides.Once the observatory is set up, it will use drones and other means to ""fully control"" what is happening in Nagorno-Karabakh, ""whether there are violations or not,"" said Cavusoglu in Baku. He hoped that Armenia ""learned from its mistakes"". If Armenia breaks the agreement, it will ""pay the price,"" added Cavusoglu.Arrests in ArmeniaIn the course of the protests against the ceasefire agreement, prominent government critics were arrested on Thursday.

Azerbaijan said it has lost 11 servicemen and one civilian in three days of fighting, and Armenia said four of its troops were killed Tuesday.The two neighbors in the South Caucasus have been locked in conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, a region of Azerbaijan that has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a war there ended in 1994. International efforts to settle the conflict have stalled.Armenian and Azerbaijani forces have frequently engaged in clashes. The current skirmishes appear to mark the most serious spike in hostilities since 2016 when scores were killed in four days of fighting.The latest incident began Sunday when Armenian and Azerbaijani troops exchanged fire in the northern section of their border. Officials in both countries blamed each other for starting the fighting and said that sporadic shelling has continued.Azerbaijan’s Defense Ministry said two senior officers, Maj. Gen. Polad Hashimov and Col. Ilgar Mirzayev, were killed in fighting Tuesday along with five other servicemen.Armenian officials claimed that Azerbaijani drones launched an attack on the Tuvush province town of Berd, targeting civilian infrastructure.

BE;Nagorno-Karabakh: Armenians block Belgian motorways to protest escalating conflict;Traffic on several Belgian motorways was at a standstill on Friday morning as protesters staged blockades in an effort to draw attention to an escalating armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.The demonstration was led by Armenian protesters who, wrapped in their national flags, spread through the E17, E19 and E314 motorways and disrupted traffic at key border crossings into Belgium.“They walked onto the highway and stopped traffic,” Peter Bruyninckx, spokesperson for the Flemish Traffic Centre told Het Nieuwsblad.Protesters in Rekkem, located in the province of West Flanders along the border with France, blocked traffic coming from both directions.In Maasmechelen, near the Dutch border, traffic was blocked for all vehicles driving into Belgium while in Meer, drivers going in the direction of the Netherlands were blocked by the demonstration.Police were able to clear 27 cars blocking the motorway in Maasmechelen as they began causing traffic jams lasting up to half an hour. The demonstrators were led to a nearby gas station.“The demonstrators want to talk to the press to bring the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan to their attention,” a police officer in Maasmechelen told the outlet.The protest comes three weeks into an armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan that erupted around three weeks ago over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian enclave in the territory of Azerbaijan.Over 300 people have already died as hostilities continue, with the collapse of a Russian-brokered ceasefire leading to fears that the armed dispute could escalate into a wider regional conflict at the doorstep of Europe.Azerbaijan and Armenia have continued accusing each other of causing the flare-up in violence, with the president of Azerbaijan —which has received unconditional backing from Turkey, a regional heavyweight hostile to Armenia— saying that “whoever fired first should stop first.”The Nagorno-Karabakh, located inside Azerbaijan but run by ethnic Armenians, has been a source of conflict since the collapse of the Soviet UnionSeveral similar demonstrations were staged in highways elsewhere in Europe, with demonstrators blocking borders crossings in Spain, France, Switzerland or Germany.;N
BE;What ‘Petit Scenario’ does Europe have for reacting to the ongoing war in Nagorno-Karabakh?;In the early hours of September 27, the World, reluctantly preparing for the second phase of a global pandemic, woke up to the news of renewed fighting between Armenians and Azerbaijanis in Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh).What on first sight seemed, to some, something usual, happening from time to time, at a closer glance offered a fundamentally different picture, even when compared to the Four-day war of April 2016.This time it was different not only because the hostilities were taking place along the entire Line of Contact between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh, but because one of the most important regional players was directly involved in the ‘Azerbaijani affair’, with its military personnel, weaponry, and even jihadist militants transferred from Libya and Syria.It was and still is dangerously different since this seemingly ‘Armenian-Azerbaijani matter’, if not stopped immediately, can potentially spill over into a full-blown war directly affecting the interests of an entire spectrum of regional actors, such as Russia, Turkey, Iran and even the EU and recently the rather disengaged US.Today is the 11th day of the war. And this morning has brought no good news for the peaceful population of Artsakh and its capital Stepanakert but renewed intensive shelling by Azerbaijan’s armed forces backed by Turkey. The violations of the International Humanitarian Law on the side of Azerbaijan are serious – use of prohibited cluster bombs, and the targeting of civilians, including reporters and civilian infrastructure.Today is the 11th day of the war and Azerbaijani leader Aliyev and its ‘Big Brother’ and fellow Turkish President Erdogan are still rejecting the unanimous calls of the international community, including the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chair countries Presidents (France, Russia and the US) to immediately cease the hostilities and resume negotiations. Meanwhile, the Armenian side, echoing these calls, signalled its readiness to engage in meaningful discussions in the framework of the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairmanship without preconditionsAzerbaijan’s leader has long been criticizing the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairmanship format, which is the only internationally agreed format for mediating the peaceful resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, that has originated not in 1988 as erroneously presented by many, but in 1921, when with Joseph Stalin the ethnic Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh was put under the jurisdiction of Soviet Azerbaijan. So, what is Aliyev’s alternative to the Minsk Group Co-Chairmanship, which is comprised of three out of five UN SC permanent members and is supported by everyone (including in the recent statement of the UNSC) except for the aggressors. Turkey?In fact, the Turkish support that had so much emboldened the Azeri leader, sunk in domestic grievances, proved itself more of a fool’s gold rather than a factor ensuring Azerbaijan’s rapid victory.The international community is clearly disapproving of Turkish direct involvement in the conflict. President Macron of France dispelled all doubts by confirming the presence of mercenaries from Syria and Libya on the ground fighting alongside Azerbaijan and imported by Turkey. This was later confirmed by other regional actors as well. President Macron, was also clear in his message that Azerbaijan’s aggression against Nagorno-Karabakh/Artsakh and Armenia had no justification.Still, the rest of the world and the international community seem somewhat reluctant to call directly on Azerbaijan to stop the hostilities and take a seat around the negotiations table. They rather prefer sticking to the good-old ‘call on all sides’ wherever possible.  This is a risky choice both because of Azerbaijan’s and especially Turkey’s increasingly aggressive behaviour in the region, and because strictly speaking you cannot require from the side that is legitimately and lawfully exercising its right to self-defence against an aggressor to put the arms aside, before ensuring that the latter has stopped shooting.It is time for the international community to act decisively and to send a clear message to Azerbaijan and Turkey that this has to stop. After all, decision-makers should not forget that Turkey is not just any country that is directly attacking Armenia and Artsakh, but a NATO member state.Moreover, once the arms are finally down, the EU should carefully reconsider the ongoing negotiations of the new EU-Azerbaijan strategic partnership agreement and its substance. Any further decision on the matter will be a real test for the EU to prove its unconditional commitment to the values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law.;E

Military mobilization was announced and a state of war was declared in several regions, after Armenia declared total military mobilization.The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is an ethnic and territorial conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh and seven surrounding districts, which are de facto controlled by the self-declared Republic of Artsakh, but are internationally recognized as de jure part of Azerbaijan. The conflict has its origins in the early 20th century. Under the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin decided to make the Nagorno-Karabakh region an autonomous oblast of Soviet Azerbaijan.The present conflict began in 1988, when the Karabakh Armenians demanded that Karabakh be transferred from Soviet Azerbaijan to Soviet Armenia. The conflict escalated into a full-scale war in the early 1990s.A ceasefire signed in 1994 provided for two decades of relative stability, which significantly deteriorated along with Azerbaijan’s increasing frustration with the status quo, at odds with Armenia’s efforts to cement it. A four-day escalation in April 2016 became the deadliest ceasefire violation to date.;N

He himself had a positive test a week ago, but he also continued to work, despite the fever and pneumonia.The shelling of Stepanakert had eased somewhat over the past week, and ambulance crews were finally able to visit shelters and cellars to search for those infected, Ohanjanjan said. He added that it was possible to resume testing and isolation of the infected.Authorities have no idea how many people have become infected so farPatients in the most serious condition were sent to Armenia, while others were treated in local hospitals or at home.

CZ;Fighting has broken out in Nagorno-Karabakh, with Yerevan and Baku reporting heavy losses;"Both sides are blamed for the escalation of the conflict.

""They're dead on both sides,"" he added later on his Facebook profile.""In addition to fighting on the front line, the enemy shelled civilian communities and military barracks. At the moment, fighting is taking place intensively along the entire front line, ""says the Karabakh authorities. According to them, rocket fire claimed the life of twelve-year-old Vaginak Grigorjan, and two other children were injured. According to Armenian army officials, the fight will end in a ""clear defeat"" of Azerbaijan.According to the Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense, the Armenian armed forces violated the agreed ceasefire and shelled the disputed territory 127 times in the past 24 hours, writes the RIA server.According to the Kavkaz-Uzel server, which refers to a statement from the Karabakh Ministry of Defense, the Azerbaijani army lost three tanks and two drones. In the afternoon, Azerbaijan admitted that it lost one tank, a Mi-24 helicopter and a dozen soldiers in the fighting, writes the Russian agency RIA Novosti.However, the Ministry of Defense said that its troops had conquered several settlements and strategic heights near the villages of Füzuli and Horadiz. Azerbaijani troops are reportedly now building trenches in new positions. ""In the fight, we destroyed six Armenian tanks, fifteen artillery devices and several engineering structures,"" said ministry spokesman Vagif Dargachli. According to him, more than a hundred enemy soldiers were killed in the fighting.In the evening, Armenian President Sergeant Sargasyan announced that eighteen Armenian soldiers had been killed and another 35 wounded. Sargasjan interrupted his stay at the Washington nuclear summit and flew to his homeland, where the Armenian government met due to the escalation of the conflict.Eduard Sharmazanov, Vice-President of the National Assembly of the Republic of Armenia, described Azerbaijan's actions as an act of terrorism directed not only against Armenia but also against all member countries of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). According to Sharmazanov, the international community should intervene against such actions, writes the Artsakh Press server.Russian President Vladimir Putin called for an immediate ceasefire. ""The president calls on the opposing parties to end the fire immediately and to exercise restraint in order to prevent further casualties,"" Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov stressed. Concerns have also been expressed by the OSCE, which wants to convene a meeting due to the escalation of years of smoky conflict.A long-standing disputeThe Nagorno-Karabakh dispute has deep roots in history. In the 1920s, the Soviets attributed this predominantly Armenian area to Azarbaijan, which laid the foundations for the bloody conflict that ignited during the collapse of the USSR.The war, which cost 30,000 lives, was started in 1988 by an incident in which pogroms broke out in Armenia in response to the killing of two young Azeris. The war dragged on for six years, and the signing of the ceasefire agreement of 12 May 1994 brokered by Russia is said to be the official end.The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said a few weeks ago that, with the proliferation of clashes, a ceasefire in the region was unsustainable in the long term. If there was a war, the situation on the battlefield would probably be far more balanced than in the 1990s. At that time, Armenia had the upper hand.Although Azerbaijan could benefit from economic dominance, Armenia was politically united, had a better-equipped army, and could count on Moscow's support (read more about the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute here).Currently, Nagorno-Karabakh is under military control of Armenia. The republic, declared by local Armenians and occupying part of Azerbaijan's territory, has not been recognized internationally. The territory is recognized only by the Armenian government.Current debates on resolving the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute are going nowhere. Baku threatens to recapture the disputed area if diplomacy does not lead to a result, and Armenia replies that it will militarily oppose any such attempt (you can see how the two states with military power are doing here).Russia has a military base in Armenia, and Yerevan, due to an alliance with Russia, refused to sign an association agreement with the European Union and joined the Moscow-led economic community.";E

""I made this decision based on an in-depth analysis of the combat situation,"" he said, according to Interfax. At the same time, he expressed his belief that, in the current situation, signing the agreement was the best solution.""This is not a victory. But there is no loss if you do not consider yourself a loser. And we will never consider ourselves a loser,"" the Armenian prime minister also said. According to him, this moment is the beginning of the ""era of national unity and revival"".Pasinjan signed an agreement with Russia and Azerbaijan after the Karabakh authorities today admitted that they did not control the second largest city of Shusha, stating that Azerbaijani troops were advancing on the regional metropolis of Stepanakert.The current fighting for Nagorno-Karabakh broke out on September 27, killing several thousand people. The dispute over the enclave in southwestern Azerbaijan with a predominantly Armenian population has lasted for decades. Armed conflict broke out in 1988 during the Soviet era. Nagorno-Karabakh, with the support of Armenia, broke away from Azerbaijan in a war that claimed 30,000 dead and hundreds of thousands of refugees. Until now, Karabakh and the surrounding area were under the military control of Armenia. Azerbaijan considers the territory to be occupied.";N
CZ;What is it all about in the Nagorno-Karabakh war?;"In the South Caucasus, war over the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave flared up again. From the point of view of Azerbaijan, it is an enclave on its own territory, which under the Soviet regime was called the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region. In the terminology of the Stalinist constitution of the 1930s, it was a lower degree of national autonomy, over which stood the autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, which territorial designation bore some territories within the so-called Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic Today 's Tatarstan, Bashkortostan or Dagestan, all enclaves with a predominance of Sunni Muslim populations, in terms of etrnicity in the first two cases of Turkic in the third ethnically mixed composition.The highest degree was the Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR). There were three in the South Caucasus, Armenian, Azerbaijani and Georgian. Let's set aside the complicated administrative set-up of the GSSR and focus on the two remaining SSRs. There, an enclave was created in the territory of the Azerbaijani SSR with a predominantly Armenian population of the above name. Not entirely, Armenians are the oldest Christian nation in the world, while Azerbaijanis are Turkish Muslims, this time Shiite. However, a number of ethnic Muslim minorities also live in Azerbaijan itself.An ingenious administrative solution according to the principle of divide and rule in the Bolshevik design.Not only did the so-called Soviet republics lose vital economic ties after the collapse of the USSR in the economic connection of the communist imperial colossus with the move from all over Moscow, but in this case it was also sown to ignite national passions.By keeping them in check on the ""joint building of communism"", Moscow secured the loyalty of these entities.Even before the collapse of the USSR, the resentment between Azerbaijan and Armenia flared up. It culminated in the war in the early 1990s, when the now stronger Armenia occupied part of Azerbaijan's territory to connect with Nagorno-Karabakh. Ethnic cleansing took place, and both countries were filled with refugees. For Azerbaijan, it has since been a direct sacred goal to recapture the occupied territories, and Armenia's sacred goal is to maintain its gains. For almost a quarter of a century, hatred has erupted in both nations (the author still remembers the days when Baku was Armen's second largest city: he himself lived in a district popularly called an Armenian village.).The Russian Federation, like the rest of the disintegrated imperial colossus, recovered from Putin's time due to expensive oil and gas, and the goal of its existence is to conquer or control the territories it had to leave after the collapse of communism (certainly including former Eastern European colonies).Thus, in the Karabakh conflict, Russia is concerned with maintaining and strengthening its influence in one of the ""near abroad"" areas. Poor Armenia, blocked by Turkey, had no choice but to accept Russian protection, becoming part of the Kremlin's Eurasian community. Azerbaijan has oil and gas, which not only brings it wealth, greater maneuverability, but also other external influences. He tries to balance them, but he definitely doesn't want to mess with Russia. As a secular state on the border with Iran (where, by the way, most of the Azerbaijani ethnic group lives, including some of Iran's top clerics), it has close, especially arms relations with Israel, and the United States has a role to play. Recently, however, the growing aggression of the Turkish neosultan Erdoğan has been trying to exploit every loophole in the region's power balance.Russia's relations with Armenia may have been weakened by the latest in a series of ""colorful"" revolutions in the countries of the former Soviet empire. On the other hand, Azerbaijan has strengthened its military power and is becoming a new object of Erdoğan's imperial appetites. After the Islamist mercenary strikes in northern Syria and Libya, this time he had the opportunity to strengthen his influence with the ethnic brothers by inciting Azerbaijani militancy. Here, however, not only does he clash with Russia as in Syria and Libya, but he ""climbs into his cabbage"" directly.He would like to seize the opportunity that the previous republican-nationalist regime in Turkey had to seize. He can't get in trouble with Russia. Erdogan's jihadist mercenaries, who he says he sends to the war against the Armenians, may also be a problem there. Not only because Russia is extremely picky about Islamist terrorism (it has bloody experience with it), but as it turns out, some of Erdogan's jihadist mercenaries are said to see a greater enemy than the Christian Armenians in Azerbaijani Shiites. The murderous hatred between two branches of the same religion that Europe went through around the Battle of White Mountain, which marks its 400th anniversary this year.In short, notwithstanding Azerbaijan's legitimate territorial demands and the Armenians' sense of threat to their identity (the trauma of their genocide comes to life as the Turks intervene in the conflict), both tortured nations are now trapped in Russian-Turkish imperial rivalry, many years of frozen conflict will be difficult to break out.Sadly, Erdoğan takes these nations hostage to distract his own population from his country's catastrophic economic situation, which he himself has caused.Additional note: Russia negotiated a ceasefire between the two rival countries and, according to a BBC report, rejected Azerbaijani President Aliyev's request to join Turkey in peace talks on the grounds that Turkey was a party to the conflict. Russia, of course, does not intend to allow Erdogan to interfere in his privileged sphere of influence. The situation is fundamentally different from the 1990s, when Turkey began to flirt with the expansion into ethnically relatedareas of the former Soviet empire. Putin's Russia is at least significantly stronger militarily than in Yeltsin's time, but on the other hand, Erdogan, who established an Islamist regime in Turkey, is also strengthening his imperial appetites. Russia will not allow this danger to be drawn into its territorial sphere. Certainly, population growth and the radicalization of Sunni's own Muslim population are enough for him.";E
DE;Foreign Minister Maas on the renewed massive clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan;Foreign Minister Heiko Maas issued the following statement today (27 September) on the renewed massive clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan:The news about renewed massive clashes between Azerbaijan and Armenia along the entire line of conflict do alert me. There are already reports of civilian casualties on both sides. I call on the parties to the conflict to immediately stop all acts of fighting and especially the shelling of villages and cities.The conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region can only be resolved through negotiations. The OSCE Minsk group and its three co-chairs stand ready to facilitate this. Armenia and Azerbaijan must  refrain from violent acts immediately and move on to substantive negotiations.;N

On display were the Turkish drones that helped bolster Baku's forces.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan renewed his calls for a change of administration in Armenia as he celebrated Azerbaijan's military victory against the country.Erdogan attended a military parade in Baku that saluted Azerbaijan's victory in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, that claimed more than 5,000 lives.He called for new leadership in Armenia, and said that it could join a regional cooperation with Azerbaijan if it took certain steps. He also raised the possibility of reopening the border between Turkey and Armenia.Turkey provided critical diplomatic and military backing to Azerbaijan in the conflict over the Armenian-majority enclave, reportedly including redeploying Turkish mercenaries from Syria to bolster Baku's army.Under a Moscow-backed agreement, Armenia ceded control over some of the areas it lost during the fighting as well as seven adjacent districts it seized during a war in the 1990s. De jure, Nagorno-Karabakh is Azerbaijani territory, but the enclave had been controlled by Armenia since the 1990s conflict.""We wish for the Armenian people to rid itself of the burden of leaders who console them with the lies of the past and trap them into poverty,"" Erdogan said in Baku on Thursday.";A

I welcome the ceasefire agreement reached on 9 November between Armenia and Azerbaijan after six weeks of bitter fighting, and urge all parties involved to safeguard human rights and adhere to international humanitarian law. Our topmost priority must now be to secure humanitarian assistance for those that need it. Efforts to this end must be anchored in the humanitarian principles of compassion, impartiality, neutrality and independence.I am grateful for the tireless commitment and work of the International Committee of the Red Cross, which the Federal Government has actively supported with funds totalling two million euro to date. In order for this assistance to reach those that need it, it is vital that the ICRC and other humanitarian organisations are granted full and unhindered humanitarian access to the local population.;N
DE;Speech by Foreign Minister Heiko Maas to the German Bundestag at the topical debate on the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh;The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, which has flared up time and again in recent years, or indeed in recent decades, has boiled over into a hot war in recent weeks. All of us have been horrified to follow these developments, especially in the last few days. We have seen the use of missiles and rockets and also of heavy combat equipment. We have heard about the number of casualties, which is increasing every day. As always in a war, the civilian population is suffering in particular. The fighting is destroying bridges, villages, roads. Tens of thousands of people have already fled their homes, and their number is constantly growing. Well over a hundred civilians have already been killed by the violence, including in areas far beyond the conflict zones.Ladies and gentlemen, we are advocating two goals in particular with a view to putting an end to this suffering. Firstly, we must alleviate the most acute suffering of people on the ground. The Red Cross, currently the only aid organisation with access to the disputed areas, asked the international community for nine million euro in emergency assistance in mid-October. As a first step, Germany will provide two million euro to help those who have lost their homes, belongings and livelihoods entirely. However, I also want to say that we continue to stand ready to do more should this be required. I say this above all in view of the upcoming winter in the Caucasus, which is already threatening to worsen the supply situation for the people still further.Secondly, an immediate humanitarian ceasefire is all the more important. Azerbaijan and Armenia must put an end to the fighting – this isn’t something that not only we, but also the international community, are calling for – with no strings attached.Both the Federal Chancellor and I have made this abundantly clear to both countries, and also to other parties involved in this context, such as Turkey, time and again. This is also the unanimous message sent by the United Nations, the OSCE and the European Union to the warring parties. In the UN Security Council, we have unanimously called on Armenia and Azerbaijan in recent weeks – and this is by no means an everyday occurrence in the UN Security Council at the moment – to finally put an end to the hostilities and return to the negotiating table. We wish to thank and are lending our support to the OSCE, which, through the Minsk Group, we believe continues to play the pivotal mediating role.But despite all this unity at the international level, we have seen that the parties to the conflict are not changing tack at present. The humanitarian ceasefires brokered by the co-chairs of the Minsk Group, France, Russia and the US, were all broken within a very short space of time, most recently at the beginning of this week. We therefore have no choice but to turn up the international pressure on both parties to the conflict. Azerbaijan and Armenia must acknowledge at long last that a military solution to this long-standing conflict will not be accepted by the international community. A better negotiating position cannot be achieved on the battlefield. There is no alternative to a ceasefire and the commencement of fresh talks. Everyone must come to realise this, both the parties to the conflict and those who are otherwise involved. A signal must be sent by all stakeholders in the region that they too are playing a decisive role in ending the bloodshed.Ladies and gentlemen, a humanitarian ceasefire would only be a first step, of course. But it is, at the end of the day, a vital prerequisite for ensuring that a lasting, namely a political, solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is achieved at long last. As a member of the Minsk Group, Germany is ready to promote the substantial negotiations that are necessary for this and which were apparently not conceivable in the past. And I wish to say that Turkey must also live up to its responsibility as a member of the Minsk Group and do its part to bring about a peaceful solution at long last.The European Union can and will play an important role in this regard. After all, with its Special Representative for the South Caucasus and the Eastern Partnership, it has instruments at its disposal to support political negotiations and, down the line, also economic reconstruction in both Armenia and Azerbaijan.Ladies and gentlemen, decision-makers in Yerevan and Baku and their supporters are ultimately faced with the choice of either fuelling a war that has already brought suffering and destruction to the people of Nagorno-Karabakh and which can all too easily turn into a regional conflagration, or – and this is the alternative for which we must strive – finally listening to the voice of the international community and changing course.In all this, you should remember that lasting peace will only be achieved if the process of de-escalation gets under way now. That is our message, and that is the clear message of the entire international community, which it has expressed with a unanimity that, unfortunately, can rarely be achieved with regard to other conflicts.Thank you.;N
DE;Armenia mourns Nagorno-Karabakh dead as PM faces calls to resign;"Armenians have begun three days of mourning to honor those killed in the recent fighting with Azerbaijan. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, accused of mishandling the conflict, faces growing calls to step down.Thousands of Armenians, led by Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, marched through the capital Yerevan on Saturday in memory of the soldiers killed in a six-week conflict with Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.""The entire nation has been through and is going through a nightmare,"" Pashinyan said in a video message before the march. ""Sometimes it seems that all of our dreams have been dashed and our optimism destroyed."" As Armenia began three days of mourning for the war that killed nearly 3,000 Armenians, Pashinyan faced growing calls from the opposition to step down over the handling of the conflict and what critics call a humiliating peace deal with Azerbaijan.The prime minister, accompanied by top officials, led a procession to the Yerablur military memorial cemetery in Yerevan to light incense on the graves of the fallen soldiers.What did Armenia agree to?The opposition, meanwhile, labeled the 45-year-old leader a ""traitor"" for agreeing to end the war in November with a Russia-brokered peace deal that saw Armenia cede swaths of the Nagorno-Karabakh region to Azerbaijan.The loss of land controlled by ethnic Armenian forces for more than a quarter of a century has angered Armenians, many of whom have been protesting against Pashinyan for weeks. Many critics chanted ""Nikol the traitor"" as the prime minister's convoy passed by, while some said he should have stayed away from the cemetery.""He must not desecrate the graves of our children,"" said Misak Avetisyan, who lost a son in the war.Heavy security was deployed at the cemetery, filled to the brink with Pashinyan's supporters who engaged in scuffles with his opponents. Pashinyan, whose wife and son were at the front during the conflict, has rejected the calls to resign. He has defended the peace deal as Armenia's only option to ensure Karabakh's survival.Opposition to stage national strikeLater on Saturday, about 20,000 opposition supporters also marched across the capital to commemorate the victims of the conflict.Armenia's opposition has called on its supporters to stage a national strike on December 22, at the end of the three-day mourning period, to pressure Pashinyan to step down.Pashinyan swept to power in a peaceful revolution in May 2018. But since the latest war, many accuse him of betraying Armenia's interests.Key public figures have joined calls for his resignation, including the influential head of Armenia's Apostolic Church, Catholicos Garegin, and 14 retired military generals who issued a statement on Saturday criticizing the government's handling of the conflict.""This war did not have to happen,"" said former prime minister Vazgen Manukyan, who the opposition says should replace Pashinyan.Armenia and Azerbaijan have for decades been engaged in a simmering conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.

It broke away from Baku in a 1990s war which claimed some 30,000 lives.The fighting that broke out in September has seen the heaviest clashes since a 1994 truce. Around 5,000 people were killed on both sides during this six-week conflict.A cease-fire was eventually brokered by Russia on November 10.The peace deal allowed Baku to reclaim control over vast swathes of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding lands previously held by Armenian forces.It prompted protests in Armenia calling for Prime Minister Nikola Pashinyan to step down. Pashinyan described the deal as necessary to prevent Baku from taking over the whole of Nagorno-Karabakh.But the deal has not entirely put an end to the violence: both countries have accused the other of violating the cease-fire.Russia, which has deployed peacekeepers to Nagorno-Karabakh to monitor the peace accord, has confirmed this.Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev warned that Armenia ''shouldn't try to start it all over again.''";N

For its part, Armenia said that six separatist fighters were injured in clashes with Azerbaijan's troops after skirmishes broke out on Friday evening.The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict erupted in September with clashes between Azerbaijan and separatists backed by Armenia over the mountainous region. Fighting supposedly ceased on November 10, thanks to a Russia-brokered peace deal that saw Armenia cede parts of its territory. More than 5,000 people, including civilians, were killed during the fighting between the ex-Soviet rivals, who had previously gone to war in the 1990s over the mountainous region. Russia has deployed nearly 2,000 peacekeepers to the troubled region for at least five years, to monitor the peace deal and to facilitate the return of refugees. Moscow confirms cease-fire violation Responding to Armenian accusations, the Baku government said the clashes over the weekend had taken place in an area that fell under its control. It said its forces had carried out a military operation against enemy forces responsible for the deadly attacks on Azeri servicemen.

EE;Nagorno-Karabakh - not a conflict between Christians and Muslims, but a little bit nonetheless;In practice, the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan cannot be described as a religious war because it does not meet the basic criteria.For example, it would be expected that one of the parties would justify or attempt to justify its actions through religion. Secondly, in this case, the main feature of the conflict should be the fight for religious identity, in this case, however, the territory and ethno-politics are central. However, the conflict has had religious aspects throughout history.For example, the genocide in Armenia during the First World War can be viewed through the prism of religion. Although this may not have been one of the main reasons, it is difficult to overlook the fact that Christian Armenia was a lonely island on the Islamic eastern border of the Ottoman state. Given that the Armenian authorities call the current events the end of the Armenian genocide, history is a significant nuance to be relied on.The direct links between religion and the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh became apparent in 1988, when both Vazgen I, the leader of the Armenian Church, and Allahshukur Pashazadeh, who held the title of Sheikh ul-Islam (Grand Mufti of the Caucasus) in Azerbaijan, took to the streets to support their people.At the same time, there was no desire to play too much of a role in the conflict at the time, and two religious leaders later met to confirm their distancing from the war.

In the war between Nagorno-Karabakh after 1992-1994, Azerbaijan lost control of Nagorno-Karabakh and the seven regions bordering the Armenian-Karabakh Republic.Negotiations have been held since 1992 to resolve the conflict by the OSCE Minsk Group, in which, in addition to Azerbaijan, Russia, the United States and France are acting as mediators. Negotiations between Azerbaijan and Armenia have been going on for three decades, to no avail. The Nagorno-Karabakh line of control is 1992-1994. The low-intensity combat operations continued until the end of the 2016 war, and before the 2020 war, the most serious battles were in April 2016.The Armenian view: we have received pogroms and killings in response to attempts at a peaceful solutionForte first asked Ruben Mehrabjan, an expert on international relations and security in Armenia and himself from Karabakh, about the development and history of the region.Why are Armenians convinced that Nagorno-Karabakh must belong to Armenia?All you have to do is go to Nagorno-Karabakh and see what churches there are. Everything is built there by the Armenians, there is nothing to talk about here. You need to see it with your own eyes and everything will be clear.Armenians suffered one of the most horrific crimes of the 20th century, the Armenian genocide. In the current war, the balance of power is very much to the detriment of Armenia. Is there a fear of a repeat of the events of 1915 in Armenia?It's not just fear, it's a fact. The current war is to drive the Armenians out of Nagorno-Karabakh. All this is being done by Azerbaijan on the pretext that these are Azerbaijani territories and that the Azeris are currently liberating their territories. It is also a fact that Armenians have already been expelled from the territory of the former USSR in the former Azerbaijan, except from Nagorno-Karabakh. This is due to the fact that the latter is under the protection of Armenian soldiers. The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is different from all other post-Soviet conflicts in that it is a war for life and death.;E
EE;Armenians set fire to their homes in areas handed over to the Azeris;"The Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh have begun to set fire to their homes in the territories under Azerbaijan under a peace agreement.This also applies to an ethnic Armenian village, Kalbajar, which comes under Azerbaijani control on Sunday. Angry and frightened villagers, about 600 people, have set fire to their homes over the agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Kalbajari, an Armenian-speaking village of Karvachari, is legally part of Azerbaijan but has been under ethnic Armenian control since 1994, when the war over Nagorno-Karabakh ended. At the end of the war, Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding territories remained under Armenian control.Although Muslim Azeris and Christian Armenians have historically lived together in these regions, a peace deal that has stopped the armed conflict is likely to only partially reduce inter-communal tensions, the Associated Press wrote.""Finally, we blow it up or set it on fire to leave nothing to the Muslims,"" ​​said one of the villagers.He packed everything that could be transported away from home. It is not yet known where the family will go.On Saturday, cars and trucks leaving Karabakh for Armenia caused a kilometer-long traffic jam.During the war that ended in 1994, hundreds of thousands of Azeris had to leave their homes. It is not clear when some civilians could resettle Karvachar.Azeris arriving in the areas must build up burnt and empty buildings. Agdam, which will come under Azerbaijani control next week, was at times a city of 40,000 inhabitants, but has now been essentially abandoned.";E
EE;Toomas Alatalu: Karabakh - a lost game and a quick end;"Delegations led by Russian Defense Minister Shoig and Foreign Minister Lavrov visited Armenia and Azerbaijan on 21 November. While the armistice of 9 November promised to create a land corridor between Azerbaijan and the breakaway region of Nakhichevan, the arrival of the head of the Russian Railways also promises to restore rail traffic between all the countries there. In Armenia, Russian prime ministers met with both President Sarkisyan and Prime Minister Pašinjan. What is important is the latter: ""Russia will support you in stabilizing the situation in Armenia and resolving the problems in Nagorno-Karabakh."" Putin's agreement to the involvement of Turkish troops in the Russian-Turkish monitoring center, which President Aliyev had already demonstrated by pre-broadcasting a telephone call (where Aliyev spoke and Putin was silent!), Was confirmed by Lavrov only at the end of the trip.During the war, Putin reaffirmed Russia's commitment to Armenia's security, stating that it did not extend to Nagorno-Karabakh, which did not belong to it. He also preferred to reiterate the principles of the OSCE Minsk Group (established in 1992 to deal with Nagorno-Karabakh). However, the President of Azerbaijan, Aliyev, only acknowledged the incompetence of the Minsk Group and referred to the resolutions of the UN Security Council and the General Assembly ""On the liberation of the occupied territory of Azerbaijan"". At the same time, most governments remembered the international law they formulated only when the war ended and it was necessary to justify their inaction.";E
ES;The three residents of Lloret who have gone to war;"The same day the war broke out, Armen Knyazyan boarded a plane for Armenia. Knyazyan was a well-known restaurant entrepreneur in Lloret de Mar (La Selva). Inflated with patriotism but without military training - with limited gun control thanks to his fondness for hunting - the 46-year-old Armenian traveled to his home country on September 27 to fight in Nagorno-Karabakh. . The region, disputed between Armenia and Azerbaijan, is the scene of a new war to which thousands of Armenians living abroad have joined. Knyazyan died on October 10 from a drone attack.Knyazyan was buried on October 17 in Lloret, according to the Diari de Girona. The coffin was covered with the flag of Artsakh, the Armenian-majority republic in Upper Karabakh. Artsakh was a self-proclaimed independent country - without United Nations recognition - in the wake of the war between Armenia and Azerbaijan between 1988 and 1994. The region has been formally part of Azerbaijan since the Soviet era. . When it disintegrated, the clash between the two communities in the territory was unleashed. Artsakh President Araik Arutiunian has awarded the posthumous medal as a national hero to Knyazyan. Arutiunian explained in a statement that he had met the Lloret businessman in 2016, during the so-called “four-day war”, the previous war escalation that took place in Upper Karabakh. His daughter, Marianna Knyazyan, explains that her father was visiting Armenia in those days and when the conflagration broke out, he did not hesitate and went to Artsakh to help his compatriots. Knyazyan on this occasion did not hesitate either. He died when a drone attacked the vehicle in which he was traveling. Marianna believes that the Azeri army targeted him because he was accompanying a prominent Armenian soldier.Armen is not the only member of the Knyazyan family who left Lloret to join the war. A cousin of his, the Sarkis, has settled in the Armenian capital, Yerevan, to take in refugees from the conflict zone: another cousin, Norik, a cook in a restaurant in this village on the Costa Brava, has been accepted by the army at the front because he had done military service. The Armenian embassy in Madrid reports that ten Armenians residing in Spain have traveled to their country of origin to participate in one way or another in the fight. ""More than 200 Armenians in Spain have contacted the embassy in order to convey their availability to travel to Artsakh when necessary,"" said a spokeswoman for the delegation.Armen Knyazyan leaves three children and a wife. Marianna admits that the three brothers have at some point thought of taking part in the war, she from Yerevan helping logistically and the two men at the front line of the battle. ""Fighting for the homeland is an example for us, but my mother and I would not allow them to leave, we do not want more losses to the family. In addition, they do not have any military experience or know the place.The Knyazyans arrived in Lloret de Mar in 2000 from Germany. A friend of Armen's suggested to him that he could find work in the village. They were among the first Armenians to settle in the municipality - now there are more than 200.

Armen Knyazyan's pseudonym was ""Barcelona"".Sargis Badalyan points out that his father has only had words of gratitude for Spain since he was granted political asylum in 1998. ""Politicians in Armenia were afraid of him,"" explains Sargis, ""he was a military man of great prestige and denounced unjust actions in the army."" Samuel Badalyan could do nothing but leave the peace of the Mediterranean coast and go back to Karabakh, says Sargis: post-traumatic stress because he had to nail the shot to a friend shattered by a bomb. That doesn't forgive him. """"The war turned him into a monster,"" says Sargis. ""My father has killed a thousand people or more. They were afraid of him and that's why he suffered seven assassination attempts.

Our patriotism is brutal. "" The Sargis adds that if Spain were attacked, they would also take up arms for the country that hosted them.";E
ES;Nagorno Karabakh, the endless conflict;Although some are Christians and others Muslims, Armenians and Azeris had reasonably lived in peace, as good neighbors, in the ethnic hodgepodge of the South Caucasus, at least until the last stages of the Soviet Union. In the heat of the greater freedom that perestroika brought, the Armenians started a protest movement to demand the annexation of the mountainous province of Nagorno Karabakh, integrated in the Socialist Republic of Azerbaijan but with an Armenian majority, to the neighboring Republic of Armenia.Protests against the Karabakh separatist movement spread in Azerbaijan, encouraged by a new batch of nationalist politicians, and in 1988 led to a brutal pogrom against the Armenian minority in Sumgayit, Azerbaijan. House by house, the Azeri nationalists forcibly removed the Armenians and killed them. The survivors fled Azerbaijan, and the same way, in reverse, did the Azeris who for centuries lived in Armenia.Shortly after the armed conflict broke out. It was a cruel and little-told war in which he killed himself viciously: they began fighting with tractors and hunting shotguns to end - once the USSR completely collapsed - by welcoming mercenaries of all stripes and fighting with the weapons left by the Red Army . The Armenian militiamen of the Karabakh, with the help of the Republic of Armenia, cleared the Karabakh and the surrounding provinces of Azerbaijanis, resulting in Azerbaijan losing about 15% of its territory. About 30,000 people died and more than a million became refugees.In 1994 a precarious ceasefire was signed and there have been successive rounds of negotiations to try to resolve the conflict. All have ended in resounding failures. Skirmishes are constant and have caused more than 3,000 deaths since the truceNagorno Karabakh has proclaimed itself an independent republic and functions as such - Mkhitaryan, like many Armenians, has donated funds for its economic survival - but no other country in the world recognizes it as a state, not even Armenia, which is the one that pays for its existence and grants passports to its population. On the two highways that link both territories, only a small border post, where many times they do not even require showing the passport, is the only sign that the country is changing.;E
ES;Clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan fuel fears of an escalation in the conflict over the Upper Karabakh enclave;"The escalation in hostilities between Armenia and Azerbaijan has caused at least 16 deaths since Sunday. The fighting on the border between the two countries, faced since the collapse of the USSR by the mountainous enclave of Upper Karabakh, is the most serious since 2016. Yerevan and Baku accuse each other of invading their territories and initiating attacks. On Tuesday night, hundreds of people protested in the streets of the Azerbaijani capital for a mobilization against Armenia. Meanwhile, Turkey, united by close ties to Baku, called Yerevan ""reckless"" and assured that its actions had been ""deliberate."" Moscow, an ally of Armenia, where it has a military base, has called for containment.Despite the ceasefire agreed in 1994, the area around Upper Karabakh and the border between the two countries has seen repeated and deadly fighting in recent years. And although the escalation stopped last night, the situation fuels fears that the conflict, latent since the signing of the truce, will reactivate and involve Moscow and Ankara. The mountainous enclave of Upper Karabakh or Nagorno Karabakh, controlled by Armenia on Azerbaijani soil, is the scene of one of the territorial conflicts that remained after the collapse of the Soviet Union.The clashes with heavy artillery have killed a civilian and 11 Azerbaijani military personnel since Sunday, including two high-ranking officers, according to Baku. Armenia, after two days without speaking of casualties, reported yesterday the death of four soldiers. There are several wounded on both sides. The incidents were located this time on the volatile border between the two countries, between the Azerbaijani cities of Tovuz and Gazakh and the Armenian area of ​​Tavush, some 280 kilometers north of Nagorno Karabakh.Azerbaijan's defense minister has accused Armenia of violating the ceasefire and trying to seize Azerbaijani territory. Meanwhile, the Armenian Defense Ministry assures that Azerbaijani drones launched an attack against the city of Berd, targeting civilian infrastructure. One of the drones was shot down, according to Yerevan, who accuses Azerbaijani forces of placing artillery and using civilians as shields in the Tavush area: also of launching cyberattacks on the websites of the Armenian Government.Azerbaijani President Iljam Aliev said the incidents are ""another provocation by Armenia"" and promised to protect his territory. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian accused the neighboring country of provoking the clashes and warned that Baku would be ""responsible for the unpredictable consequences of regional destabilization.""Last night, for the first time since Sunday, there were no major escalations, but hundreds of people demonstrated in Baku. There, waving Azerbaijani flags they chanted slogans such as ""Karabakh is ours, and will remain ours"" or ""Supreme Commander, give us arms!"" The police evicted this morning a group of protesters who broke into the Azerbaijani Parliament at dawn to demand military action against Yerevan.During the time of the USSR, Upper Karabakh was an autonomous province of Azerbaijan, inhabited by a majority of Armenians. In 1988, the Armenians in the province passed a resolution calling for joining Armenia. A conflict then broke out, causing some 25,000 deaths and hundreds of thousands displaced. In 1994, Armenian forces seized control of the enclave and other territories that it claims as a “security strip”. It is considered an independent region and is linked to Armenia by a corridor. Azerbaijan believes that the solution to the conflict involves the return of the territories and claims that various resolutions of the UN Security Council support it. In 1994, Baku and Yerevan reached a ceasefire and led a resolution to the conflict within the framework of dialogue of the so-called Minsk group (co-led by Russia, the US and France and under the auspices of the OSCE), but since then they have been incidents occurred. The most serious four years ago, which also coincided with the deterioration of relations between Moscow and Ankara.Azerbaijan, an oil power whose military spending exceeds the entire budget of Armenia, has recently increased its armed forces and threatened to act to regain control of Upper Karabakh. But they are measured actions, says the analyst specializing in the post-Soviet space Alexander Sytin, Armenia belongs to the Collective Security Treaty Organization, a political-military alliance led by Moscow, in addition to hosting a Russian base on its territory.Turkey has expressed its support for the Government of Iljam Aliyev. ""The incident is not a violation or border conflict, but a deliberate attack directly against Azerbaijan,"" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday. ""Armenia will fall into the hole it is digging for others, ”he added during a meeting of his cabinet, as quoted by the daily Hürriyet.Russia is trying to activate the diplomatic channel so that the escalation does not go further. Yesterday, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke with his Armenian and Azerbaijani counterparts to call for an immediate ceasefire. Moscow, says the Kremlin, is ""deeply concerned"" by the clashes and has called ""for moderation"" to both countries.The conflict worries the international community not only because of instability in the southern Caucasus, a region that serves as a corridor for gas and oil pipelines that transport gas to various markets. Also from the point of view of the action of regional powers with influence in the area. Moscow and Ankara have good relations now, but they also maintain an uneasy alliance because of their support for warring parties in Syria, and now Libya as well.";N
ES;Upper Karabakh, a conflict of more than 30 years that threatens to escalate into a regional war;"When he saw the extent of the attacks against Stepanakert and other areas of Upper Karabakh, Hovig Asmaryan decided to send his three children to spend time with their relatives in Yerevan. Asmaryan, an ethnic Armenian Syrian from Aleppo, arrived in Upper Karabakh in late 2012, fleeing the war in Syria. In the mountainous enclave, on soil internationally recognized as Azerbaijani but controlled by Armenia, he bought a farm and recently opened a Syrian and Mediterranean restaurant. It was not bad for him, account by video call from Stepanakert. The region, ravaged in the Yerevan-Baku war for control of the enclave in the early 1990s, had been revitalized and modernized thanks, in large part, to donations from the large Armenian diaspora. Today, the scars of the conflict are once again visible on the buildings and streets of the region, and Asmaryan, 50, is experiencing another war.The Upper Karabakh - or Nagorno Karabakh - in the South Caucasus, with 150,000 inhabitants (the vast majority of Armenian ethnicity) and which has claims of self-determination, has experienced the most serious clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan since 1994, the date on which a ceasefire was signed and has been continuously broken. A war now open in a heavily militarized region that can lead to a spiral that fully involves regional powers: Russia, due to its influence in the region and its defense agreement with Armenia, and Turkey, with an increasingly expansive appetite and imperialism, which supports Azerbaijan and is testing Moscow's influence in the South Caucasus.The recent clashes between the two former Soviet republics, the latest chapter in a latent conflict lasting three decades, are of increasing concern to the international community. War may further destabilize an area that acts as an important energy corridor for global markets: very close to the front line is a gas pipeline opened last year that runs through Turkey, aimed at easing Europe's dependence on imports. of Russian gas.On Saturday, after more than 10 hours of negotiation sponsored by Moscow, Armenia and Azerbaijan, they announced a ceasefire aimed at exchanging prisoners and recovering the dead, under the mediation of the Red Cross. A truce that, however, has already been broken a dozen times. Yerevan and Baku accuse each other of attacks against civilians. Armenia reports 20 civilians and 525 soldiers killed. Azerbaijan, which has not disclosed its military casualties, claims that more than 41 civilians have been killed and 205 injured since the start of hostilities on September 27.Lika Zakaryan says that since practically since then she has lived in a small bomb shelter with three other people in Stepanakert. ""My house was hit by one of the attacks and we no longer have electricity or gas there and the living room is missing a wall,"" says the 26-year-old, who was born in Upper Karabakh after the war in the early 1990s. lasted six years. Zakaryan, who studied Sociology but who in recent months worked for an information website about the region, explains on Skype that her 24-year-old brother, her boyfriend and a good number of his friends are at the front.Despite the ceasefire and as talks on how to develop it continue in Moscow, the leader of the region, Arayik Harutyunyan, has announced that he is meeting with veterans of the war of the n + oventa so that they also get involved in the battle. ""The situation is fatal,"" he wrote on Facebook. The authorities in Upper Karabakh accuse Azerbaijan of initiating the confrontation and attacking civilian targets. ""Azerbaijan has deliberately attacked more than 120 civilian settlements,"" insists local politician David Babayan from his office in Stepanakert by video call. In addition to residential buildings, Babayan talks about bridges, water and electricity installations, and also communications. On Thursday, two attacks destroyed much of Shusha Cathedral and seriously wounded three Russian informants.Baku denies it and accuses Armenia of attacking a residential area in Ganja, the country's second city, after the signing of the ceasefire and at dawn. Azerbaijani authorities have reported nine civilians killed and 34 injured, according to a note from the Foreign Ministry. Media on the ground in Ganja, such as France 24 or the BBC, have broadcast images of the enormous damage caused in the area by what Baku identifies as a ballistic missile. ""If Armenia continues to attack civilian targets, Azerbaijan will be forced to take necessary measures against military targets,"" said presidential adviser Hikmey Hajiyev.Lawyer Tatev Asaryan was born in Upper Karabakh the day after the signing of the 1994 ceasefire between Baku and Yerevan, after the war that caused some 30,000 deaths and thousands of displaced people and for which a peace agreement was never signed. Through a precarious Internet connection and from one of the Stepanakert shelters, he assures that, despite the fact that normal life has practically stopped, families are making an effort so that children follow their classes in one way or another.The Red Cross, which has provided emergency medical supplies to hospitals and body bags to the Nagorno Karabakh forensic office, as explained in a note, also warns of the spread of the covid-19 pandemic among a refugee population in bunkers and with worse access to health facilities. Also of the arrival of the cold, says the head of human rights of Upper Karabakh, Artak Beglaryan. ""50% of the population have had to leave their homes, some to shelters within the region, others to Armenia,"" Beglaryan said by phone from Stepanakert. Like Yana Avanesyan, who left Upper Karabakh when an artillery attack hit her sister's house. ""It was not safe and we decided that it was better to go out to Yerevan than to stay in a shelter,"" says Avanesyan, a law professor at Stepanakert University who specializes in humanitarian law, by video call. She does not know when she will return.The latent confrontation for the mountainous enclave that several UN resolutions recognize as part of Azerbaijan began before Avanesyan was born, which has not yet reached thirty, and is the result of the conflicts inherited from the former USSR and its collapse, which combine territorial and ethnic tensions in a tumultuous South Caucasus. But this latest outburst is different. Not only because it comes at a time when both Armenia and Azerbaijan have much more sophisticated weapons, points out the expert in the area Thomas de Waal, who also highlights the intense information war on television and social networks: also because of the involvement of Turkey, which has offered its most direct support to its ally Azerbaijan in an area of ​​traditionally Russian influence, which adds another new and complex component. All of this increases the risk of the local conflict becoming regional. The one in Upper Karabakh would join the conflict in Libya and Syria, where Ankara and Moscow support rival sides.Armenia has a defense agreement with Russia, which supplies arms to Yerevan but also to Baku, which has also invested a large part of the money earned with oil in buying defense material also from other suppliers, such as Israeli and Turkish drones that, according to Russian military expert Pavel Felgenhauer, are giving you a comparative advantage. In addition, different reports from Armenian, French and Russian intelligence as well as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights indicate that dozens of Syrian mercenaries have come to the front to fight for Azerbaijan but financed with Turkish money. Turkey denies it.Ankara's intervention and Baku's requests to participate in the negotiating table deeply scare Armenia and stimulate the memory of the persecution of Armenians by the Ottoman government in which more than 1.5 million died. A massacre recognized as genocide by a good number of countries. “It is very difficult to find a common language with the Turks, this is what history has taught us. But we are prepared to resist and fight to protect our people, ”remarks farmer and restaurateur Hovig Asmaryan.";E
ES;Armenia and Azerbaijan declare a ceasefire in the war in Upper Karabakh and accuse each other of breaking it within hours;"Azerbaijan and Armenia agreed on Saturday a humanitarian truce starting at midnight this Sunday (22:00 on Saturday in Spain), according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Armenia and also confirmed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan. The truce, according to the Azerbaijani diplomacy statement, was agreed upon in response to the October 1 declaration of the presidents of the United States, Russia and France, who represent the countries co-chairs of the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security in Europe (OSCE). The ceasefire, however, has hardly had any effect. Both countries have accused each other of violating the humanitarian truce in the early hours of Sunday.The Upper Karabakh, a breakaway region of Azerbaijan populated mainly by Armenians and supported by Yerevan, has been the scene of bloody fighting since September 27. According to an official balance, although very partial, more than 700 people have died in the clashes.""Despite the declaration of a new humanitarian ceasefire, the Azerbaijani armed forces have once again violated the agreement,"" Shushan Stepanyan, a spokesman for the Armenian Ministry of Defense, wrote on his Facebook profile. Stepanián specified that ""around 7:20 (local time), with the support of artillery fire, the enemy launched an offensive in the southern sector (Judaferin reservoir) in order to occupy advantageous positions."" ""There are casualties on both sides,"" he added.In turn, the Ministry of Defense of Azerbaijan denounced that the Armenian forces attacked with mortar and artillery fire “the surroundings of the city of Dzhabraíl and the villages liberated from the occupation in the homonymous district that are located along the Araz river. ”.This was the second attempt by the belligerents to consolidate a ceasefire after almost three weeks of fighting in the disputed separatist region of Upper Karabakh, in which hundreds of people have died. Hours before the announcement of the truce, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov held telephone conversations with his Azerbaijani counterparts, Jeihun Bayramov, and Armenian, Zohrab Mnatsakanyan.According to Moscow, Lavrov insisted before his interlocutors on the importance of the agreement reached in the Russian capital to begin, together with the ceasefire, ""substantive negotiations"" in order to reach a peaceful settlement to the conflict. That ceasefire was never fully implemented, and military actions intensified instead of diminishing. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliev announced on Sunday the liberation of the city of Füzuli and seven other towns in the Armenian-occupied region of the same name south of Upper Karabakh.The Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict dates back to the times of the Soviet Union, when at the end of the 1980s the Azerbaijani territory of Upper Karabakh, populated mainly by Armenians, requested their incorporation into neighboring Armenia, after which a war broke out that caused some 25,000 deaths. At the end of the fighting, which lasted until 1994, the Armenian forces took control and also occupied vast Azerbaijani territories, which they call the “security strip”, to unite them with Armenia.Azerbaijan maintains that the solution to the conflict with Armenia necessarily involves the liberation of the occupied territories, a demand that has been supported by several resolutions of the UN Security Council. For its part, Armenia supports the right to self-determination of Upper Karabakh and advocates the participation of representatives of the separatist territory in the negotiations on the settlement of the conflict.";E
FR;Thousands of Armenian civilians flee their homes in wake of Nagorno-Karabakh truce;"Around 100,000 Armenian civilians have fled their villages, homes and even their loved ones in the wake of a Moscow-backed truce that called for Armenia to hand over control of some areas it holds around the Nagorno-Karabakh region.Some refugees have found their way to makeshift centres where volunteers and aid workers offer support.“They had to leave everything behind in the disaster,” said one woman who offered assistance. “They need everything – food, hygiene kits, even clothes – because winter’s on the way.”Many are still searching for missing family and fear the worst.One woman, Alla, told FRANCE 24 she had four children at the frontline. The most important thing, she said, was to find them.“After that, we’ll see what life has in store and how we’ll continue to live.”She fled with her daughter while she could, but her husband and their other children remained in Nagorno-Karabakh. Like many others she found Armenians waiting across the border with open arms.Among them a woman who has opened up her home to the refugees: “They’ve been with us since October 3. It’s not very comfortable for sleeping, it’s no five-star hotel, but they want for nothing.”“We all live together. If we were in their position, they’d do the same for us,” she said.The fate of Alla’s sons is ever in mind as is that of their hometown Shushi, which is now under Azerbaijani control.“We’ll hope we can go back to Stepanakert, maybe,"" she said.";E
FR;Nagorno-Karabakh – Statement by Jean-Yves Le Drian, Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs (10 Nov.2020);Announcements were made last night by Armenia, Azerbaijan and the Russian authorities regarding the implementation of a ceasefire agreement in Nagorno-Karabakh. We have taken note of the agreement and are examining its terms and implications. Clarifications are expected in order to assess their impact.The cessation of fighting is crucial. The parties had made this commitment several times over the last few weeks and we have been, and remain, strongly committed to this priority within the framework of the co-chairmanship of the Minsk Group. We therefore expect Azerbaijan to strictly uphold the commitments that it has made and to put an immediate end to its offensive. In this context, we call on Turkey not to do anything that goes against this key priority.At this difficult time, France reaffirms its wholehearted friendship with the Armenian people in light of our close human, cultural and historic ties with Armenia. In these tragic circumstances, we stand alongside it. In particular, we will work to lend it all the humanitarian support it needs. Indeed, the situation on the ground, with displaced populations and fighting in urban centers, has resulted in serious humanitarian consequences.France has mobilized its efforts in recent weeks through a very large number of civil society initiatives. The French authorities are contributing to these initiatives, providing medical assistance, which arrived late last week in Yerevan and included teams of surgeons specialized in treating conflict victims. Other initiatives will be taken in the coming days to provide Armenia with the help it will need.Finally, the resumption of negotiations between the parties on a lasting settlement of the conflict remains necessary, beyond the ceasefire announced yesterday. As co-chair of the OSCE Minsk Group, France will be an active participant in this effort. Discussions between the two parties must resume without delay. They must allow for the return of people displaced by the conflict in recent weeks, and for the definition of the future status of Nagorno-Karabakh.;E

It must now be implemented and strictly respected in order to create the conditions to bring a permanent end to hostilities between the two countries.Substantive talks, to which the parties have committed under the auspices of the Co-Chairs of the Minsk Group, must resume without preconditions. France remains fully committed to contributing to these talks.;N
FR;Nagorno-Karabakh - Communiqué issued by Jean-Yves Le Drian;I spoke in turn to the Armenian Foreign Minister, Mr Mnatsakanyan, and the Azerbaijani Foreign Minister, Mr Bayramov, to discuss the major crisis under way in Nagorno-Karabakh since 27 September. The conversations built on many discussions held between France and those two countries since Sunday, at every level, particularly between the French President, Prime Minister Pachinyan and President Aliyev.During the discussions, I once again expressed the urgent need to secure an end to hostilities, immediately and without preconditions. Their continuation would only increase the number of casualties – particularly civilian ones –, the material and human costs endured by both sides, and the threat of an uncontrolled escalation between Armenia and Azerbaijan. I warned my interlocutors about the threat of the conflict being internationalized.In the spirit of the American, French and Russian Presidents’ statement on 1 October, I emphasized France’s determination, as Co-Chair of the Minsk Group, to play its full role, impartially, in securing an end to hostilities and the immediate resumption of substantial negotiations without preconditions, under the aegis of the Co-Chairs of the OSCE’s Minsk Group.Finally, I thanked my interlocutors for their respective contributions to the medical evacuation under way of the two Le Monde journalists injured in Nagorno-Karabakh yesterday.;N
FR;Situation in Nagorno-Karabakh – Statement by the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs Spokesperson;France is deeply concerned about the large-scale clashes which have broken out in Nagorno-Karabakh and reports of civilian casualties in particular. It calls for the immediate cessation of hostilities and the resumption of dialogue.In its capacity as Co-Chair of the Minsk Group, France, with its Russian and American partners, reiterates its commitment to reaching a negotiated, lasting settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, with due regard for international law.;N
FR;Nagorno-Karabakh: 'Everyone benefits from Russia-brokered ceasefire deal except Armenia';"Russia brokered a ceasefire deal on Monday that secured territorial advances for Azerbaijan in the ethnic Armenian breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh. But some analysts say that Azerbaijan, Turkey and Russia all benefit from the agreement while protests have sprung up in Armenia accusing Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan of betraying the national interest.The Russian-brokered ceasefire deal on November 9 ended six weeks of conflict between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces – and envisages the use of Russian troops as peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh.The agreement, which entails Armenia accepting Azerbaijani gains in the region, has prompted demonstrations in Armenia calling for Prime Minister Pashinyan’s resignation and accusing him of “betrayal”. Russia is a longstanding Armenian ally, leading many Armenians to see the ceasefire deal Moscow arranged as another betrayal.Russian President Vladimir Putin made the announcement himself at midnight from Monday to Tuesday, emphasising that the deal enshrines “a total ceasefire” and “cessation of military hostilities” in Nagorno-Karabakh.Russia deployed some 2,000 troops as soon as the ceasefire came into effect. According to the treaty signed by Yerevan, Baku and Moscow, they will be deployed as Armenian forces leave areas under Azerbaijan’s control – that is to say, seven districts around Nagorno-Karabakh and a small part of the region itself. The now diminished self-proclaimed republic will remain under the protection of Russian soldiers. These troops will play a notable role in protecting the Lachin corridor, the only supply route connecting Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia.A win for Azerbaijan – with Putin’s blessing?Azerbaijan looks like the big winner in this conflict with its neighbour and bitter rival. Significantly, the territories it has gained include the historic and strategic city of Shushi, which is located on the road linking Armenia to the separatist capital Stepanakert. Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliev was certainly keen to present this as a triumph for his country – hailing Armenia’s “surrender” and calling Pashinyan a “coward” for not signing the deal in front of the cameras, adding that he said “we would chase them off our land like dogs, and we did”.Galia Ackerman, a Paris-based historian specialising in Eastern Europe and author of Régiment Immortel: La Guerre sacrée de Poutine (“Immortal Regiment: Putin’s Sacred War”), argued that Azerbaijan has enjoyed Putin’s “tacit” backing: “Regardless of whether it’s under Armenian or Azerbaijani control, Nagorno-Karabakh is not a priority for Putin,” she told FRANCE 24. “The way he sees it, letting the war take its course was a means of trying to get rid of Pashinyan and change the political situation in Armenia.”“Pashinyan was elected after a popular uprising in 2018 and was starting to look a bit too independent, as far as Moscow was concerned,” Ackerman added. “Notably, he got rid of a few people from his pro-Russian security services.""For his part, Pashinyan acknowledged that the ceasefire terms are a blow to Armenian national pride, describing the deal on his Facebook page as “incredibly painful for me and my people”.‘Everyone benefits except Armenia’Despite the arrival of French and American diplomats in Moscow on November 12, Paris and Washington did not play a role in the ceasefire accord. France and the US, along with Russia, co-chair the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which is tasked with ensuring peace in Nagorno-Karabakh.“What is very important for the Kremlin is the diminished role of the West, which was mainly self-inflicted by the lack of focus” under US President Donald Trump, Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center, told AFP.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is another big winner of this resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis. A close ally of Azerbaijan, Ankara will monitor the implementation of the ceasefire using a joint observation centre.“There is a new regional order in the making, with Russia still indispensable, growth of Turkish role, and diminishing relevance of the West,” Gabuev wrote on Twitter.“Russia was very struck by Turkey’s involvement in Caucasian geopolitics,” Gaidz Minassian, an Armenia specialist at Sciences-Po University in Paris, told FRANCE 24.“Ankara got involved at all levels – especially on a military level – and now we can see how much more importance Azerbaijan places on ties with Turkey compared to those with Russia.”In fact, all parties involved came out ahead – expect for one. “Turkey emerges particularly strengthened from this, but of all the players involved in this conflict, everyone benefits except Armenia,” Ackerman concluded.“Russia regains its grip on Armenia and gets boots on the ground in Nagorno-Karabakh: Turkey strengthens its links with Azerbaijan: and Azerbaijan is delighted because they have recovered territory that separatists had occupied for more than a quarter of a century.”";E
FR;Lives saved, territory lost: Armenians protest Nagorno-Karabakh deal;"Armenia and Azerbaijan agreed on a deal with Russia to end weeks of fierce clashes over Nagorno-Karabakh on Tuesday, after a string of Azerbaijani victories in its fight to retake the disputed region.The announcement of a full ceasefire sparked outrage in Armenia, with angry protesters storming the government headquarters in Yerevan where they ransacked offices and broke windows.Crowds also seized control of parliament, calling from inside the chamber for the resignation of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan after he announced the “painful” deal to the end the fighting.“I have signed a statement with the presidents of Russia and Azerbaijan on the termination of the Karabakh war,” Pashinyan said, calling the move “unspeakably painful for me personally and for our people”.“I have taken this decision as a result of an in-depth analysis of the military situation,” he added.Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev said Pashinyan had been left with no choice but to sign the “historic agreement”.Armenians see Nagorno-Karabakh peace deal as 'complete capitulation'‘A capitulation’“An iron hand forced him to sign this document,” Aliyev said in televised remarks. “This is essentially a capitulation.”Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed that both Armenia and Azerbaijan had agreed to “a total ceasefire” that would create the conditions for a long-term settlement of the conflict.He said the two sides would hold on to areas under their control and that Russian peacekeepers would be deployed along frontlines and to secure a corridor connecting Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenian territory.Russian news agencies quoted the defence ministry as saying 1,960 peacekeepers would be deployed with 90 armoured vehicles.Putin announces deployment of Russian peacekeeping troops to Nagorno-KarabakhAliyev said Armenia had agreed to a timetable to withdraw its forces from large parts of the region and that Azerbaijan’s ally Turkey would be involved in implementing the ceasefire.The deal would end six weeks of fierce clashes over Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian region of Azerbaijan that broke away from Baku’s control during a bitter war in the 1990s.The conflict—which has simmered for decades despite international efforts to reach a peace deal—erupted into fresh fighting in late September.More than 1,300 people have been confirmed killed, including dozens of civilians, but the actual death toll is believed to be significantly higher.With Russian peacekeepers deployed, Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire is ‘likely to stick’Strategic town seizedAzerbaijani forces made steady gains over the weeks of fighting, sweeping across the southern flank of Nagorno-Karabakh and eventually into the region’s heartland.A turning point came on Sunday when Aliyev announced that his forces had captured Shusha, the region’s strategically vital second-largest town.Shusha sits on cliffs overlooking Nagorno-Karabakh’s main city Stepanakert and on the main road to Armenia, which backs the separatists.Armenia insisted earlier on Monday that fighting for the town was continuing but a local separatist official admitted that Shusha was “completely out of our control”.The ceasefire deal came just hours after Azerbaijan admitted to accidentally shooting down a Russian military helicopter flying in Armenia.Moscow’s defence ministry said two crew members were killed when the Mi-24 helicopter was hit close to the border with Azerbaijan. A third crew member was injured and evacuated.Azerbaijan quickly apologised and blamed the incident on the “tense situation in the region and increased combat readiness” of its forces.The helicopter was shot down near the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, a landlocked exclave of Azerbaijan between Armenia and Turkey, far from Nagorno-Karabakh.Mounting anger in ArmeniaRussia has a military pact with Armenia and a base in the country, but had insisted it would not get involved in the conflict with Azerbaijan unless Armenian territory itself came under threat.Karabakh declared independence nearly 30 years ago but the declaration has not been recognised internationally, even by Armenia, and it remains a part of Azerbaijan under international law.Repeated attempts at ceasefires brokered by France, Russia and the United States—who together lead the “Minsk Group” that has sought for years to end the conflict—repeatedly failed over the last few weeks.Azerbaijan has been pushing for Turkey’s involvement in a settlement and the new deal came after Putin spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday.Anger had already been mounting in Armenia ahead of the agreement, with 17 opposition parties on Monday calling on Pashinyan and the rest of his government to immediately resign.The parties said in a statement that Armenia’s leaders bore “the entire responsibility for the situation” in Karabakh.“The authorities have lost their moral and political basis to represent the people,” they said.France says deal must 'preserve Armenia's interests'On Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron called for a ""lasting political solution"" to the conflict and urged Turkey to ""end its provocations"". France, home to a large Armenian population, has crossed swords repeatedly with Turkey on a range of issues, including Nagorno-Karabakh.Macron's office said it was studying the parameters of the Russian-brokered ceasefire, adding that a long-term deal should also ""preserve Armenia's interests"".Macron's office quoted him as saying that efforts should be made ""without delay"" to try to come up with a ""lasting political solution to the conflict that allows for the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh to remain in good conditions and the return of tens of thousands of people who have fled their homes.""Earlier in the day, Putin said displaced people would be able to return to Nagorno-Karabakh and prisoners of war would be exchanged.A spokesman for the Kremlin said there had been no agreement on deploying Turkish peacekeepers in the disputed region, but that the Turkish military would help staff a joint monitoring centre with Russian forces.";E
FR;Azerbaijan says key Karabakh town captured, Armenia says it didn't happen;"Azerbaijan said Sunday its forces had captured the key town of Shusha from Armenian separatists in Nagorno-Karabakh, but Armenia insisted that fighting for the strategically vital area was ongoing.The capture of Shusha would be a major victory for Azerbaijan six weeks after new fighting erupted over Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian enclave that broke away from Azerbaijan's control in the 1990s.The fortress town sits on cliffs around 15 kilometres (nine miles) from Nagorno-Karabakh's largest city Stepanakert and on the main road through the region to the territory of Armenia, which backs the separatists.Both sides have reported fierce clashes around the town in recent days, after Azerbaijani forces swept across the southern flank of Nagorno-Karabakh and pushed through its mountain passes.In a televised address to the nation on Sunday, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev announced that the town had been captured.""With great pride and joy, I inform you that the town of Shusha has been liberated,"" said Aliyev, dressed in military fatigues and standing in front of an Azerbaijani flag.""Our liberation march continues. We will go to the end, until the complete liberation of the occupied territories,"" Aliyev said.Celebrations in BakuFlag-waving Azerbaijanis celebrated in the capital Baku after Aliyev's announcement, with cars honking their horns as residents crowded along city streets despite coronavirus restrictions.""I did not leave the house for a week, but today I came out to say that Shusha has been liberated. We are happy, congratulations to all my people,"" 32-year-old Baku resident Shargiya Dadashova said.Armenian officials said the battle was far from over.""The fighting continues in Shushi, wait and believe in our army,"" Armenian defence ministry official Artsrun Hovhannisyan said, using the Armenian name for the town.Armenian defence ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan said there was ""the most ferocious combat"" for the town, while the Armenian government said taking Shusha was an ""unattainable pipe dream for Azerbaijan"".""Despite heavy destruction, the fortress city withstands the blows of the adversary,"" it said.In the streets of the Armenian capital Yerevan, residents said they did not believe the town had been taken.""To know who controls Shushi we will listen to the commanders of our army, not Aliyev,"" 50-year-old Arman said on the city's central Abovyan Street. ""In any case I can assure you that the war will not be finished if the Azerbaijanis take Shushi.""Shusha had been a majority Azerbaijani city before the 1990s conflict and has been a rallying cry for authorities in Baku promising to retake Nagorno-Karabakh.New clashes broke out in late September between Azerbaijan and the Armenia-backed separatists over control of Karabakh, which declared its independence nearly 30 years ago.That declaration has not been recognised internationally, even by Armenia, and it remains a part of Azerbaijan under international law.The recent flare-up has been the worst in decades, with more than 1,000 people confirmed dead including dozens of civilians, although the death toll is believed to be much higher. Diplomatic effortsFighting has continued despite several attempts by Russia, France and the United States to help reach a ceasefire. The three countries make up the ""Minsk Group"" of mediators that helped broker a truce between the ex-Soviet rivals in 1994 but have failed to find a lasting solution to the long-simmering conflict.Diplomatic efforts appeared to intensify as the fighting raged around Shusha, with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday speaking by phone to Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan and French President Emmanuel Macron.Turkey is a key ally of Azerbaijan and on Sunday Erdogan congratulated Baku after its claim of retaking Shusha, saying it was ""a sign that the liberation of the rest of the occupied territories is near"".Turkish involvement would be key in any agreement to halt the fighting and there were reports Sunday of a plan to agree a ceasefire and deploy Russian and Turkish peacekeepers to Nagorno-Karabakh.Ankara has been a fierce supporter of Azerbaijan, a fellow Muslim and Turkic country, while Moscow has a defence pact with Armenia and a military base on its territory.Aliyev met Sunday with the Turkish foreign and defence ministers in Baku.Dmitry Trenin, a political analyst and head of the Moscow Carnegie Center, said the conflict had reached a ""decisive point"".""Russia and Turkey are finalising the modalities of (a) ceasefire, Armenian withdrawal, corridors and peacekeepers,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""New regional order is being sealed.""";E
FR;Armenia and Azerbaijan allege breaches as new ceasefire begins;"Armenia and Azerbaijan accused each other of violating the latest ceasefire to halt fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh shortly after it took effect on Monday.Azerbaijan's foreign ministry said Armenian forces had shelled the town of Terter and nearby villages in ""gross violation"" of the truce, which was announced by the United States on Sunday.Armenia's defence ministry said Azerbaijani forces had ""grossly violated"" the ceasefire with artillery fire on combat positions in various parts of the frontline.The latest ceasefire was due to take effect at 8 am local time (0400 GMT) on Monday, according to a joint statement by the US State Department and the governments of Azerbaijan and Armenia.""Congratulations to Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, who just agreed to adhere to a cease fire effective at midnight. Many lives will be saved,"" US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter.The announcement came after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo held separate meetings with the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan in Washington on Friday.Those meetings were joined by the co-chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group, formed to mediate the conflict and led by France, Russia and the United States, which described them as ""intensive discussions"" on the ceasefire and the beginning of talks about core elements of a comprehensive solution.The Minsk Group said its co-chairs and the foreign ministers agreed to meet again in Geneva on October 29.A senior administration official expressed confidence that this ceasefire would hold. ""US leadership with support from Russia and France brings additional hope that the ceasefire will lead to a lasting peace settlement,"" said the official.But the eruption of new fighting on Sunday and the collapse of two previous ceasefires brokered by Russia raised questions about the prospects for this fresh push to end the clashes in Nagorno-Karabakh, a part of Azerbaijan populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians.Fears of wider conflictThe fighting that broke out on September 27 over the disputed territory has surged to its worst level since the 1990s, when some 30,000 people were killed.Local officials in Nagorno-Karabakh on Sunday accused Azeri forces of firing artillery on settlements in the areas of Askeran and Martuni during the night. Azerbaijan said its positions had been attacked with small arms, mortars, tanks and howitzers.Armenia accused Azeri forces of shelling civilian settlements. Baku denied killing civilians and said it was ready to implement a ceasefire, provided Armenian forces withdrew from the battlefield.The defence ministry of the Nagorno-Karabakh region said on Sunday it had recorded another 11 casualties among its forces, pushing the military death toll to 974.Earlier on Sunday during a meeting with defense officials, Aliyev accusd Armenia of bombarding civilian sites and launching two ballistic missiles on the city of Ganja.Armenian President Armen Sarkissian accused Baku of being ""aggressively stubborn and destructive"".World powers want to prevent a wider war that draws in Turkey, which has voiced strong support for Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia.Differences over the conflict have further strained relations between Ankara and its NATO allies, with Pompeo accusing Turkey of fuelling the conflict by arming the Azeri side. Ankara denies it has inflamed the conflict.Sarkissian, in comments reprinted by the Armenpress news agency, called on ""global players"" to step in immediately to bring about a ceasefire and said Russia was ""a trusted and pro-active mediator"" between the conflicting sides.Aliyev said it was ""very hazardous"" for Armenia to want Russian military support in the conflict and third parties should not get involved militarily.Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he speaks to leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan several times a day by phone, and that he hopes the United States will help Moscow broker a solution to the conflict.About 30,000 people were killed in a 1991-94 war over Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenians regard the enclave as part of their historic homeland: Azeris consider it illegally occupied land that must be returned to their control. ";E

Youri Djorkaeff, whom President Macron appointed to mobilize French aid for Armenia.This visit was in line with the humanitarian effort instituted by President Macron and Foreign Minister Le Drian for the population affected by the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and was coordinated by the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs’ Crisis and Support Center.The delegation led by the Minister of State arrived aboard an aircraft leased by the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs that carried donations collected by the Aznavour Foundation and humanitarian cargo supplied by humanitarian organizations and corporate foundations. This flight followed an initial cargo flight that arrived in Yerevan on November 22 carrying official donations of emergency medical equipment, including a Mobile Medical Station capable of serving 500 people, blankets, and hygiene kits. Mr. Lemoyne delivered these donations in the presence of Armenian Health Minister Arsen Torosyan. He visited sites that receive French aid, including two hospitals that care for seriously wounded patients and a city hall that welcomes people who had to flee the conflict.Mr. Lemoyne was hosted by Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Foreign Minister Ara Ayvazyan. He assured his interlocutors of France’s determination to work actively in support of a negotiated settlement to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in its capacity as Co-Chair of the Minsk Group.

FR;Armenia - France establishing a mechanism to assist Armenians affected by the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh (22 November 2020);At the request of President Macron and the Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs, France is establishing a structured effort to assist Armenians affected by the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. Coordinated by a steering committee at the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs’ Crisis and Support Center, this mechanism mobilizes the efforts of the government, associations promoting solidarity with Armenia, humanitarian organizations belonging to Coordination Sud, corporate foundations and hospitals. It focuses on three areas.1/ After initial emergency actions in recent weeks involving the dispatch of surgeons and medical/surgical supplies to Armenia, several humanitarian flights have been organized. An initial cargo plane leased by the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs arrived in Yerevan this afternoon. It was transporting items donated by French authorities: emergency medical equipment, and in particular a Mobile Medical Station allowing for the care of 500 people as well as blankets and hygiene kits to be distributed to people affected by the conflict.A second flight has been scheduled for November 27. Its cargo will include State resources, donations collected from associations promoting solidarity with Armenia such as the Aznavour Foundation and the Union Générale Arménienne de Bienfaisance, and humanitarian cargo supplied by humanitarian organizations and corporate foundations.2/ Following on from the medical missions conducted since October, the second area of focus involves stepping up cooperation between hospitals in both countries. This will be facilitated by financial support from the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs. In France, the public hospitals of Paris, Marseille and Lyon have already been mobilized.3/ The third area focuses on supporting projects instituted in Armenia by humanitarian organizations and UN agencies. France will provide direct financial support for these structures that are active on the ground.Finally, local governments, some of which are already actively supporting projects in Armenia, have been invited to contribute to these three areas of focus.This mechanism for providing humanitarian assistance comes in response to the emergency situation created by the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh in recent weeks.In its capacity as co-chair of the OSCE Minsk Group together with Russia and the United States, France also remains fully committed to achieving a lasting solution to this conflict. /.;E

GE;"Trenin: ""The Armenians Will Have to Eat their Bitter Humble Pie"" & Georgia Draw Lessons";The second Karabakh War is seemingly over, and as one side celebrates and another mourns, experts, opinion makers and their ilk are trying to gauge what the Kremlin-brokered, Erdogan-approved truce might bring. How will the power balance change in the region, who are the winners and losers, and, finally, what impact will it have on Georgia? These are the topics GEORGIA TODAY put to one of the Moscow Carnegie Center's most prominent faces, Dmitri Trenin.By far the most important and basic question is how does this new deal change the power balance in the region?It establishes a new balance in the region, a new regional order if you like, which is supported by two of three principal powers outside the region: one is Russia, the other Turkey. I think this new order legitimizes Turkey's inclusion in the South Caucasus balance. Turkey has certainly increased its profile in the South Caucasus, while Russia has reconfigured its role in the region, becoming the one power that can act as a mediator between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Turkey will not be able to perform that role. Then again, we have to realize that Moscow is no longer the dominant power in the South Caucasus, has not been for a long time now, in fact, and I don't think Moscow will recover that position. Azerbaijan will be very much aligned with Turkey, Armenia is under a question mark, but Russia has rediscovered its role as the only power that is accepted both in Yerevan and Baku, and that provides it with potent leverage. Let us not forget that Russia is very worried about the stability of the of the northern Caucasus, an area where it fears, should the war in Karabakh continue, there will be more jihadis, more outsiders from outside the region who come to Karabakh and stay in the Caucasus. An influx of jihadis from outside the region would be bitter irony for Russia- to have fought the jihadists in Syria only to see them much closer to home.Why did Russia remain so inactive and only now manage to broker a truce? Was it premeditated?I would disagree that Russia played a waiting game to mediate a truce between Armenia and Azerbaijan. They tried to broker a truce exactly a month ago, when the situation was very different, and no-one can say that it was a pro-forma exercise. I think the motivation of the Russian side was to stop the conflict as soon as possible. My chief argument is that Russia cares more about the northern Caucasus than it does about the southern.A counter argument to that would be that genuine ceasefires brokered by Russia are not usually violated in 7 hours, as happened here. This new one does not look like it will be violated anytime soon.No, because continuation of the war would lead to the utter and complete defeat of Armenia, very likely the total banishment of Armenians from Karabakh, and the total seizure of the entire territory by Azerbaijani forces. That is what essentially made the Armenian side agree to the ceasefire.Azerbaijan has been exercising this policy of strategic patience and militarization for 26 years, and it has been enjoying military superiority over Yerevan for more than a decade. Why act now?There was a confluence of several factors, one of which was the Turkish factor. Turkey played a major role and, as we know, in the months preceding the war, supplied Azerbaijan with lots of hardware, lots of expertise that the Azerbaijanis used in this war. It was also the time when the United States is distracted with its own election and then the transfer of power. Thirdly, President Aliyev benefited from Russia’s displeasure and distrust of Pashinyan and his government. He kept stressing in interviews with the Russian media “you have a Soros-appointed prime minister in Armenia who is not really your friend.” The moment was opportune for Aliyev. I think he decided to launch what they call a counter-offensive against the offensive that stopped 26 years ago.Do you see Russia using the peacekeepers, who will control the Lachine corridor, as a leverage to keep Armenia under its thumb?They will control the Lachine corridor, and that will give them leverage, no question about that. Russians are looking at their alliances, and one school of thought in Moscow is that “if people want our protection, they have to be good allies: they have to stand with us: they shouldn't be ashamed by being closer to us because you know you cannot expect Russia to bail you out and at the same time try to impress the West how pro-Western you are: you need to choose.” If Russia holds the keys to important Armenian positions, then it indeed has leverage, and if Armenians want to reject that kind of arrangement, they are free to do so as a separate country. The pro-Western part of Armenian society could ask themselves why the US hasn’t done more for them, and if the US is not available for whatever reason as your protector, then even though you may have reservations, you have to be a good and honest ally to Russia.Are we talking about alliances here, or vassalage?I don’t think the term vassalage belongs in today's world, it doesn't belong in an analytical vocabulary, it belongs in the vocabulary of calling names. Mr Putin calls European countries “American vassals.” What it means is that you have to be seriously and honestly friendly toward Russia: have a genuine, sincere alliance with Russia. It's more like a wedding: if you wed somebody, it doesn't mean that you are somebody's vassal, but it certainly means that there are certain rules to be observed, there are certain things that you will not do as long as you want to keep that marriage going. Of course, you can get out of that marriage, and even marry somebody else: it's a free choice.How is that different from creating the spheres of influence that are so derided today?Russia’s sphere of influence in reality is very small: it includes very close to Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Donbas. Russia is working very hard to reconfigure its relationship with Belarus as we speak, that's very important. What Belarus is being offered is not a sphere of influence, it's something different, it's very close to integration.What about Armenia? Will it remain Pro-Russian?Armenia is not a Russian sphere of influence. I think the Armenians will have to eat their humble pie, which is very bitter, and I think there's a tremendous disappointment. I hope that Armenia will use this: defeat is always an opportunity, as when you are defeated, you become self-critical. I hope it doesn't turn the Armenian political class into a bunch of revanchists.On to Turkey. How does its increased presence in the South Caucasus change things?I think we’re living in a world now in which regional powers are more empowered than ever. Turkey has not become the dominant power in the South Caucasus as a result of the second Karabakh War, but they have gained not only a foothold, but a legitimized presence with another great power. Moscow will have to take Ankara more into account, that's for sure. Moscow and Ankara are rivals, but they are also partners in a limited sense of the word. They managed to compete, and they managed to negotiate and reach deals, and it gives you a promise that Turkey and Russia will not clash. I hope that they don’t clash.After trying the diplomacy approach for 26 years without luck, Baku achieved what it wanted in month and half through military might. Will it lead onlookers to think this is the only way to get back what you think is rightfully yours in Post-Soviet conflicts?An interesting question. All supposedly frozen conflicts can unfreeze at some point, and this is something that I'm saying here to the Russian audience: watch Karabakh and come to the conclusion that other conflicts can suddenly unfreeze and then confront you with a real security issue. Here, I’m talking primarily about Transnistria, but also about others.There are also situations when Moscow itself unfreezes conflicts. Do you see Russia trying to unfreeze the conflicts in Georgia?I think Russia is satisfied today, having Abkhazia and South Ossetia as its military bases. Does Russia want more? I don't think so. I mean, Russia in 2008 could have sent its military into Tbilisi. They chose not to do that not because of the French or the Western efforts: they exercised restraint based on their calculus of the negatives that would have surely followed after the Russian military's entry into Tbilisi. in 2014, there were people who argued that Russia should not stop with Crimea and Donbas and should march on Kiev and keep Ukraine under control. I think Putin chose wisely not to do so. Even today, Russia could have sent forces into Belarus to prop up Lukashenko, but they didn't. There are certain things you can do, but you would rather not because the negatives of doing so far outweigh the positives.What are the negatives?In Georgia, Russia doesn't really need Georgia: it needs Abkhazia to protect Sochi, which is Russia's de facto third capital: with Georgia very friendly with the US and potentially an American base in the future, they would want to have some protection from that side. South Ossetia places the Russian military within an hour's drive of Tbilisi: it's like a gun to your temple. Russia doesn't need more. Does it want to fight to make Georgia…what? To make it another Armenia? There are so many people in Georgia who are anti-Russian, what would you do with them? Once you step into such a territory, it would require a massive infusion of capital and money. Russia doesn't have that money to spend on Georgia, and even with Abkhazia and South Ossetia there are issues. The empire that could afford that, glorious as it was for many Russians, is history.Does the Nakhichevan corridor which has been speculated, if it materializes, threaten Georgia's transit country status?I would doubt it would play a very important role. There will be a competitor to the transit lines that run through Georgia, yes, but I don't think Azerbaijan will place so much of its transit in the hands of the Russians who will patrol the corridor. The status of Georgia as a transit country is not in danger.Any other impact this second Karabakh war could have on Georgia?It’s a useful warning that it's better to have conflicts resolved diplomatically: I think it applies to Georgia. there are two things I’ll say: the Abkhaz would not want to live under Georgian rule, and I think that it applies vice versa: I don't think the Georgian people who live in Abkhazia are happy to live under Abkhaz rule. The second thing I think is true is that South Ossetia will never be a full-fledged state. In happier times, before the Russian-Georgian war. I often mused about the future status of South Ossetia as some sort of Andorra that is a separate state but both Spain and France regard it as part of its own territory and it can function, with three statuses merged into one. You can do these things, I mean, there's no limit to how resourceful diplomats can be.That would be a kind of marriage between Russia and Georgia?Yes. Whether that’s still on the cards is another question though. It’s something that perhaps needs to be given more thought.;N
GE;Hans Gutbrod on Karabakh: Peace Perspectives & the Impact on Georgia;As the rest of the expert and opinion making world is busy trying to determine who the winners are and what the next clever scheme of Putin’s might be, Ilia State University's Professor Hans Gutbrod discusses peace perspectives after the Karabakh truce.“For now, this is a ceasefire: we will still need to see how actual peace arrangements develop, and everything will hinge on this,” he says. “The question of Karabakh had been hanging over the Caucasus like a Sword of Damocles. Now that sword is down, with painful losses, and for the time being, it is still a moment of grief.“But beyond that grief, if we manage not to put another Sword of Damocles up, that would be an achievement. At least the question of returning hundreds of thousands of displaced Azerbaijanis may be resolved, and this could be a new beginning. If the settlement gives a dignified solution to Armenia, this would greatly help long-term stability.”How does this new deal change the power balance in the region?Perceptive Russian analysts have pointed out that Russian engagement in Syria could be seen as a trial-run for Central Asia: how do you keep stability in a country where the president is the not-particularly-competent son of an authoritarian leader, while keeping Russian military engagement as small as possible? It's not necessarily that the Russians believe these authoritarian leaders are great, but more that they don't see a viable alternative to stability. While people in Georgia know the downsides of Russia, it’s worth remembering that the West hasn't delivered great solutions in these difficult contexts either, not in Syria or Libya, nor in Afghanistan. Russia may soon face this substantial challenge in Central Asia, with multiple transitions, right on their doorstep, and with quite a few ethnic Russians as well.If we follow that interpretation, the Kremlin learned in Syria that they could live, broadly, in sorting these arrangements with Turkey, even if Turkey was on the other side: both sides kept out the West, looked after their own interests, soaked up local constituencies as allies, and kept out the radical Islamists, which are a worry both for Russia and for Turkey. In that way, Russia may have felt that even when they are on the other side, Turkey plays by the same rules of the game, and that they are broadly comfortable with having them in the region, also to keep out China, which will be a concern in Central Asia. Karabakh may just be part of this much broader understanding.Again, this puts it into an incredibly broad sweep, but there may be something to this perspective.On the impact of Russian peacekeepers in particular: how is it going to affect things?Russian peacekeepers are apparently seen as a very big factor for Azerbaijan. In the end, I'm not sure how substantive they will be, as it’s a small contingent. It's more of a tripwire, and a way for Azerbaijan to have a presence that explains, internally, why they don't take over Stepanakert. This certainly was a popular demand, but would have created all sorts of problems, ranging from potential ethnic cleansing, to potentially having an unhappy Armenian minority. Notably, the former US diplomat Matt Bryza, well known in Georgia and now working with oil-connected companies in Azerbaijan, warned that Azerbaijan would have “international pariah status” if it engaged in mass ethnic cleansing.Who are the winners and losers?First, the losers are all the families that have lost a son, a father, a brother or an uncle. This is what war does: it brings irrevocable loss. When speaking about the future, one may want to recall that many families may not even have buried their dead yet. This is a time of grief.Second, it is still a bit unclear who the winners will be. You can win a conflict, but still lose the peace: arguably this is what happened to Armenia, which won in 1994, but didn't manage to turn this into a lasting peace, and we have been living in that warped world of closed borders and armed front lines for almost three decades. I think the challenge now is to find something that will actually open up the region, and to build something that gives us the prospect of leaving all this terrible past behind.The fact that Azerbaijan’s strategic patience and militarization approach actually enabled them to achieve their goals might be seen as a demonstration that it’s the way to go for other countries.Various countries will look at this with great attention, to figure out what the lessons for them are. Practically everywhere, you see discussion on the use of drones. It's an unpleasant subject, but the war was a little bit like cavalry against machine guns. That said, one can expect that militaries will adapt quite quickly, and more developed countries will find this easier.One should be careful not to exaggerate: in this case, Azerbaijan had Israeli weapons, Turkish weapons and officers, outsized wealth compared to Armenia, and Armenia's strategic partner decided not to take an interest. This is a rare alignment, and I'm not sure that, say, Ukraine, can learn much when it comes to its own separatist territories.What does the future hold for Karabakh itself and its status?Again, I think this will become apparent in the upcoming negotiations. If Azerbaijan and Turkey play this well, it’s possible there will be arrangements that Armenians can live with: that give them dignity in the moment of defeat: in which borders open, trade begins, people can (cautiously) cross back and forth. The key is to avoid the mistakes of the past, and to try to push for a solution that the various sides can live with, with dignity.This is a radical thing to say, but I think it might make sense to think about a much more comprehensive settlement of conflicts beyond Karabakh, too, so that societies can focus on making life better for their citizens, and addressing the many pressing challenges.Could it be a lesson for the West on how games are played in this region?The West is very good at a particular kind of politics, at developing institutions, at being respectful to its own citizens, at building social infrastructure, and creating a desirable place to live. The very people that often speak dismissively of the West buy expensive apartments in Chelsea or Manhattan, and send their children to boarding school in Switzerland.At the same time, the West just isn't good at cutting through the proverbial Gordic knot. That's not how Western bureaucracies function.The West will maintain a strong role, but for different kinds of games. These games, if that’s the right term, are actually really important to make lives better for citizens by developing economic institutions, capital markets regional integration, and delivering good education. In that way, I think the West will likely continue to matter in the region.What will the impact be for Tbilisi?Right now, I think it’s just a huge relief that the fighting is coming to an end. To thrive, Georgia needs to live in a peaceful Caucasus.Perhaps this is a moment to recognize both the Azerbaijanis and Armenians in Georgia, as well as the Georgian authorities, for their managing to keep the peace, in what was a terribly difficult time. There were small gestures, such as the Saturday night vigil for peace by Malkhaz Songulashvili, the Metropolitan Bishop, assisted by both Azerbaijani and Armenia religious figures. This was admirable, in such a difficult time. It has been said many times, but I do think that Georgia can be a model for coexistence between Armenians and Azerbaijanis.Does the potential Nakhichevan corridor and border with Turkey threaten Georgia’s transit country status?The potential corridor does reduce Georgia's transit country status, but this may not be a bad thing for the country. As the writer and critic Akaki Bakradze said a long time ago, carrying a freshly cooked chicken past me gives me the smell, but not the food. I'm not convinced that hundreds of trucks crossing Georgia every day leave that much in terms of revenue and development. I think it makes more sense to focus on other areas of development, including high-revenue tourism, export agriculture and manufacturing. These are the fields of real opportunity, and will require much more patient work to turn into a success.;N
GE;Russia, Turkey Agree Creation of Nagorno-Karabakh Ceasefire Monitoring Center;"The Russian and Turkish defense ministers signed an agreement on Wednesday on the establishment of a joint ceasefire control center in Nagorno-Karabakh.""The memorandum of creation of a joint Russian-Turkish center for ceasefire supervision in Nagorno-Karabakh has been signed following videoconference talks between Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and his Turkish counterpart Hulusi Akar, the Russian Defense Ministry reported Wednesday,"" news agency TASS reports.

GR;Armenia ‘will not tolerate a second genocide,’ country’s president tells Kathimerini;Six weeks after Azeri forces launched a military offensive on Nagorno-Karabakh, the deadly clashes continue, the successive ceasefires collapse before the ink on the deal has even dried, and the noose around the Armenians is tightening. In this interview with Kathimerini, Armenian President Armen Sarkissian speaks of an attempted ethnic cleansing against the people of Nagorno-Karabakh, adding that his people will not tolerate a second genocide, 105 years after the historic crime carried out by the Ottoman Empire.Sarkissian claims that Turkey has already transferred jihadi mercenaries from fighting in Syria and Libya, “like those who are now in Paris and Vienna or elsewhere killing innocent citizens.”Concerning a political solution to the problem, he says that the attack launched by Baku, with support from Ankara, “dramatically dispelled any desultory hope that some foreign experts used to harbor about peaceful coexistence of the Karabakh Armenians and Azerbaijanis within the boundaries of Azerbaijan.” The dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh has turned from a frozen conflict into a war of attrition for the last six weeks. Could you describe the situation on the ground and give us an idea of the human toll for the Armenian people?I wouldn’t call the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict “frozen” because the Azeri side has always been trying to change and challenge the status quo by military means since a ceasefire was established between Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan back in 1994 reached with the mediation of Russia. Instead of using the negotiation table to reach a final solution to the conflict during almost three decades, the Azeri side not only didn’t refrain from regularly and deliberately violating the ceasefire agreement and killing Armenian soldiers on the line of contact and civilians, both in Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia, but it was buying a large amount of modern weaponry worth billions of US dollars, including some prohibited ones, and turning the entire region into a powder keg. Moreover, Azerbaijan has been preparing its own population for a war, while the Armenian side then and now was a strong proponent of peaceful solution, and the Armenian elites were even sometimes criticized by some opposition representatives for being too peace-oriented instead of increasing military spending and harsh rhetoric.Since the early 90s, Azerbaijan has increased its military budget by 10 times, and has never refrained from heavy xenophobic and militaristic rhetoric. Now we are witnessing its genocidal intentions in full action. Moreover, this inhuman aggression unleashed by the non-democratic Azerbaijani regime on September 27 is militarily and politically supported by another non-democratic regime in Turkey. Dictatorships don’t care about the destiny and prosperity of their own people, let alone respect simple human lives, values and dignity. A non-democratic regime, be it in Baku, Ankara or elsewhere, builds its “strength” and “pride” on the suffering of its own people, and hence, is of course more than inhuman toward other nations. Nagorno-Karabakh is not a conflict but a struggle of the pride of the Armenian nation for its security, proud life and dignity vs killings, humiliations and suffering.As for the human toll of the Armenian people, there is always official daily information provided by the Armenian government which doesn’t hide those figures, unlike the Azeri side, which doesn’t deliver any information about its human or other losses. Every life of the Armenian side matters for us, and it’s not about numbers or mathematics. The beating of every single heart of the Armenian side is priceless to us, and we need to stop the bloodshed.Who is to blame for the violations of three consecutive, temporary ceasefire agreements?All three ceasefires or humanitarian truce agreements have been almost immediately violated by the Azerbaijani side, which not only didn’t stop its bombardments, but shelled the territory of Armenia as well. This may sound illogical to you if you want to understand why an agreement is reached if the Azeri side is not going to respect but just to breach it immediately. Well, the logic is that the Azeri, not the Armenian side unleashed this well-planned and designed military aggression and war with a direct participation of Turkish generals, officers, special military units, Bayraktar death machines, as well as jihadists and Syrian mercenaries like those who are now in Paris and Vienna or elsewhere killing innocent citizens. The same is here in Nagorno-Karabakh: professional killers of Azerbaijan and Turkey against innocent people. Why does the Azeri side sign but is then motivated to violate ceasefires? It’s simple: Those dictators both in Baku and Ankara didn’t finish with their “mission,” which lies in “freeing” Nagorno-Karabakh from the Armenians living there for thousands of years.This operation or policy is called ethnic cleansing, which is the ultimate goal of this inhuman aggression by Azerbaijan and Turkey against the population of Nagorno-Karabakh. That’s why the Azeri side is not interested in stopping its genocidal policy against the innocent people, but to finalize it. Under the name of establishing their control over Nagorno-Karabakh, they don’t want peace but tragedies, killing of civilians, destroying churches, hospitals and kindergartens, and spreading terror. Who on earth will agree to live with those barbarian terrorists? During about 25 years of negotiations Azerbaijan didn’t agree to any scenarios discussed under the auspices of the OSCE Minsk Group co-chairs, be it mediated by Russia, the US or France, or by all three co-chairs altogether. Because the only option Azerbaijan was in favor of, is to have Nagorno-Karabakh without Armenians. This is what happened 105 years ago with my nation in the Ottoman Empire, known as the Armenian Genocide. We will never allow another genocide to happen. Never! And this is what the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is about.Your Azeri counterpart, President Ilham Aliyev, insists that a military solution to the conflict is feasible. Given the fact that Azerbaijan outnumbers Armenia in terms of military equipment and manpower, how could you possibly prove him wrong?My nation doesn’t need to prove anything to anybody. The strength of the Armenian Armed Forces and the spirit of the Armenian nation were showcased during the first war in Nagorno-Karabakh in the late 80s. So, it’s not about a simple calculation of numbers and quantity. We fight for our homes, our homeland, children, and the preservation of the Armenian cultural heritage of thousands of years. This is what some fail to understand. This conflict was imposed on us because Nagorno-Karabakh, overwhelmingly populated by Armenians, didn’t want to continue its forced existence with Soviet Azerbaijan and declared independence from Azerbaijan according to all existing rules and laws – by the way, applying the same procedures that Azerbaijan used to get its independence from the Soviet Union. The Azeri side, as a true dictatorship, doesn’t like freedoms and rights of its own and other peoples, and they tried to solve the problem with the Armenians living in Nagorno-Karabakh by using military equipment and manpower, outnumbering Armenians, as you put it. So, they imposed war on us, and got retaliated against and defeated. Nothing and nobody can stop a nation from exerting its right to live freely and in security.Would it be fair to say that the president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, encourages Baku to adopt a most intransigent behavior? If so, to what end?The role of Turkey in this conflict deserves special attention and understanding. This direct participation increases the number of conflicting sides, and internationalizes the conflict. Turkey’s proven involvement on the ground, although denied by the Turkish side, levels up the conflict and dramatically increases the scope, the magnitude and hence the consequences of the military aggression by Azerbaijan. The presence of fanatic jihadists and Syrian and other mercenaries renders the whole picture even more complex and complicated and endangers the security of the entire region which can turn the Caucasus into a new Syria.Not only does Turkey encourage Baku to become a blind killer of peaceful people and to violate ceasefire agreements, but it keeps Azerbaijan as its hostage, transforming it into its new tool of political manipulation against Russia, the EU, the US and Iran. In the short term, Azerbaijan can be happy to have Turkey by its side and have its full support in the war against peaceful Nagorno-Karabakh, but in the mid- and long terms, it will be a failure, and only then will Azerbaijan realize to what extent it has become Turkey’s Caucasian puppet at the expense of its own politico-economic independence, maneuverability, stability and predictability. Turkey is a regional player with imperialistic ambitions and appetite, but with limited resources and a fading international reputation. It is messing up in Syria, Libya, the Eastern Mediterranean etc. So, using Azerbaijan to achieve its goals by also encouraging and pushing it to unleash a war is the least it can do in the region and beyond.Ankara and Baku portray themselves as guarantors of Europe’s energy security, claiming that Armenian forces could shell the oil and gas pipelines crossing the region. Is it a real threat or just scaremongering?This is a matter of unsubstantiated allegations and respective propaganda the government of Azerbaijan and the paid propagandists of its national interests in the West and elsewhere have tended to spread for decades. The consistent attempts to portray Armenia as a destructive force of the region that allegedly “poses a threat” to the energy infrastructure was and still remains a backbone of anti-Armenian fictional narratives the Azerbaijani side has fostered for foreign audiences. This aims to serve as moral justification for the ongoing aggression and war it wages against the Armenians. Despite numerous fabrications and intentional false interpretations diligently pushed by the Azerbaijani side on this matter, I can find no statement or sign of hidden intention by any acting Armenian top official ever which might contribute to such allegations. To the contrary, as recently as in July, when the fighting in the Tavush/Tovuz sector of the Armenia-Azerbaijan state border reached its apogee, the incumbent prime minister of Armenia, Nikol Pashinyan, came up with a clear statement reiterating that Armenia has never had any intention or plan to harm the oil and gas supplies stretching close to the Armenian border. Moreover, the Armenian side remained constructive with regard to the energy infrastructure that appears important for the economies of Europe, Turkey, Israel and so forth, prudently highlighting its share of responsibility with regard to the security of those critical economic arteries.After all, if Armenia ever wanted to target and destroy the gas and oil pipelines, it has had multiple chances to do so. But why should we? After years of groundless and irrelevant Azerbaijani scaremongering and subtle manipulations to seed anti-Armenian sentiments abroad, it is regrettable to see that some political circles in Europe and beyond have started to buy some misleading fake narratives such as this one.Russia is seen as a trusted and proactive mediatorRussia is an ally of Armenia, and has signed military agreements with it which do not include the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Moscow is currently acting as an honest peace broker, a non-biased mediator. Do you expect something more at these most difficult times for your nation?Russia is Armenia’s strategic ally, and Moscow remains committed to the security-related treaty arrangements it has with Yerevan. President Vladimir Putin made it clear that Russia is going to respect each agreement Russia has with Armenia, and this is an absolutely clear message. During a recent discussion, Vladimir Putin pointed out that while the overall bilateral relationship is growing positively, the interests of Turkey and Russia do not coincide when it comes to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Here in Armenia, in the context of the politico-military rivalry with Azerbaijan, Russia is seen as a trusted and proactive mediator between the conflicting sides. Russia plays a crucial role here and it demonstrated its commitment to finding a peaceful solution to the conflict by brokering a ceasefire on October 10. And we must admit, it was a courageous and timely move, even though the Azeri side remained aggressively stubborn and fully destructive, violating the ceasefire.One of the key problems at this stage of the conflict that is of mutual concern to Yerevan and Moscow is the appearance of jihadists from Syria, Libya and elsewhere that Turkey transfers to Azerbaijan for their further fighting against Armenians. According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, about 2,000 of them have already reached the region. For decades, the region was free from Islamic fundamentalism, and now we have such a non-state actor inside Azerbaijan that employs terrorism as a new inhuman tool against civilians. This is a very destructive factor for regional destabilization, something atypical for our region, and indeed poses a serious challenge not only for the regional powers, but first and foremost for the Caucasus states proper, since the jihadist mercenaries in Azerbaijan increase the security risks for global projects and foreign infrastructure investments. By the way, those mercenaries pose a real direct threat to Azerbaijani society as well.Armenia appreciates Moscow’s efforts as both treaty ally and honest broker to stop the flaring and hybrid war perpetrated by Azerbaijan and Turkey, and I am confident that this challenge we are facing now is positively testing the tight strategic bond between Armenia and Russia.After one-and-a-half months of warfare, the Azeris have made territorial gains and a return to the status quo ante seems impossible. What kind of political solution would seem both realistic and acceptable to you?Let me put it this way. The intensive phase of the war in Nagorno-Karabakh is under way, and diverse tactical maneuvers cannot be considered territorial losses or gains. Let me remind you that in summer 1992, it might have seemed like the Armenian side was losing the war, seeking to repel the Azerbaijanis’ first aggression against the people of Nagorno-Karabakh. But by May 1994, when Azerbaijan desperately asked for a ceasefire, the situation on the ground was starkly different.As for the political solution, it is clear that such cruel and inhuman aggression perpetrated by Azerbaijan and orchestrated by Turkey, accompanied by multiple cases of war crimes and inhuman treatment of prisoners of war, dramatically dispelled any desultory hope that some foreign experts used to harbor about peaceful coexistence of the Karabakh Armenians and Azerbaijanis within the boundaries of Azerbaijan. For the Armenian side, this aggression once again came to justify that the only realistic option for the Armenians of Karabakh to survive is the recognition of their right to live and develop in their historical homeland outside Azerbaijan. So the only recipe of survival for the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh is to acknowledge that Karabakh, with its reliable territorial connection to Armenia, can never be part of Azerbaijan.A natural allianceThe Armenian and the Greek peoples are connected by historical and cultural ties. What would you expect from our government and our people at this critical moment of your history?Greece and Greeks have a special place in the minds and hearts of the Armenians. The natural alliance of the Armenians and Greeks was multiply tested through the centuries, making our bond not only historical or cultural, but civilizational, based on people-to-people sympathy, a similar mentality, a shared historical destiny. The dynamics of political relations between our nations has proved that Armenia and Greece might benefit from a shared geopolitical vision and state-to-state strategic relationship, projecting our regional standings together. One vivid example is the trajectory of strategic trilateral partnership between Greece, Armenia and Cyprus. As long as the threat to our interests and security comes from the same source, Greece has a strong position in the European institutions at large and in NATO in particular, to exert pressure on a consistently defiant and increasingly unreliable Turkey. Greece is in place to raise legitimate concern and a set of actions underpinning or, if necessary, representing Armenia’s voice in this matter. We may unite our political weight and capabilities to take tangible measures along with other allies in the West to institutionally make Turkey and Azerbaijan accountable for their destabilizing and destructive actions. ;E
GR;Menendez calls for halting arms sales to Turkey, Azerbaijan;Democratic Senator Bob Menendez has submitted two resolutions to Congress, calling for the halt of arms sales to Turkey and Azerbaijan, reports say.“Azerbaijan’s ongoing aggression against the Armenian people – with Turkey’s full backing – has already exacted a painful toll on civilians in the region and resulted in appalling human rights abuses. The United States cannot continue providing security assistance and arms to Azerbaijan and Turkey as they move the region further and further away from peace,” Menendez said, according to the same reports.“Turkey’s pattern of violence extends beyond the South Caucasus to Syria, Iraq, and Libya, and both President [Ilham] Aliyev and President [Recep Tayyip] Erdogan have inflicted appalling abuses on their own people. This resolution pushes back against Azerbaijan’s and Turkey’s human rights abuses and paves the way to stop arming two governments that so often use their security forces to harm innocent people,” Menendez was quoted as saying.;E

HU;Azerbaijani community living in Hungary is worried about the escalation of war between Azerbaijan and Armenia;Azerbaijani-Hungarian Youth Union (AHYU) contacted Daily News Hungary to express the worry of Azerbaijani community living in Hungary about Armenia’s violent military breach of ceasefire at around 6 AM on September 27, 2020 which lead to the escalation of war. The Armenian armed forces intensively fired on the positions of the Azerbaijani army as well as densely populated civilian settlements using large caliber machine guns and sniper rifles. Therefore, there are continuous casualties among the civilian population and military personelle of Azerbaijan, many houses and civilian facilities were severely damaged. Such actions of Armenia overburden medical facilities as well as healthcare system of Azerbaijan, especially during pandemic.The deliberate targeting of civilians is a gross violation of international humanitarian law, including the Geneva Conventions of 1949. This is the continuation of military provocation happened in Tovuz in July 2020. Moreover, Armenia also settles many terrorists from different countries, such as Lebanon and Syria in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan and recruits them for their army to fight against our army. Unfortunately, Armenia does not want to implement UN Security Council Resolutions 822, 853, 874 and 884, UN General Assembly resolutions on the Situation in the Occupied Territories of Azerbaijan adopted in 2006 and 2008, and ignors the appeals of the WHO and other influential international organizations regarding the current pandemic, as well as the norms and principles of international law.Moreover, the Board Members of AHYU thanked Hungary for supporting the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan since the conflict started. It was also noted that Azerbaijani-Hungarian relationship improved over last several years, especially trade, scholarship programs, business opportunities and cooperation on youth level improved between two countries. There are currently more than one thousand Azerbaijani people who live, work and study in Hungary and they are deeply concerned that peace in the Caucasus region is under a grave danger.;A
HU;Armenian armed forces target Azerbaijani civilians, tensions rise again in the zone of occupation;Continuous Armenian military build-up on the east and almost daily provocations aimed to test the extent of Baku’s patience has sparkled the flame of a full-scale war on the line of contact and state border with Azerbaijan on Sunday morning.Following massive Armenian artillery shelling of the Azerbaijani villages along the border and the early reports of civilian deaths and destruction of residential houses, the President of Azerbaijan, who is under the constitution also the Commander-in-Chief of the Azerbaijani army, ordered the counter-offensive with the aim to silence the enemy’s firing positions, reported Azerbaijani state media.As the Armenian military blatantly violated the ceasefire, the Assistant to the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Head of Foreign Policy Affairs Department of the Presidential Administration Hikmat Hajiyev made a statement, informing about the Armenia’s night assault on the Azerbaijani villages of Gapanli of Tartar district, Chiragli and Orta Garavand of Aghdam district, Alkhanli and Shukurbayli of Fuzuli district and Jojug Marjanli of Jabrayil district. “The bombardment of densely populated civilian areas and installations situated along the front line by Armenia’s armed forces has been deliberate and targeted.

He reminded that Azerbaijan had warned many times that Armenia is preparing for a new act of aggression and war, Armenia’s ongoing military aggression against Azerbaijan and the presence of the armed forces of Armenia in Azerbaijan’s occupied territories posed significant threat to regional peace and security.Targeting the civilian population is a tactic incorporated in the combat training of Armenia’s armed forces, and the Khojaly genocide perpetrated in February 1992 has been a vivid testimony to that. According to the international law, Armenian armed forces’ strikes against the positions of Azerbaijan’s army, against the civilians and civilian infrastructure, with the use of large-caliber weapons, are Armenia’s yet another military aggression and an act of the use of force against Azerbaijan”, said Hajiyev, charging Yerevan with the full responsibility for the current tensions.;A
HU;Azerbaijani community in Hungary is worried about the situation on the frontline between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces;Azerbaijani-Hungarian Youth Union (AHYU) contacted Daily News Hungary to express the worry of Azerbaijani community living in Hungary about Armenia’s violent military breach of ceasefire.  Armenian army has been attacking Azerbaijan with heavy artillery in the direction of Tovuz region since the 12th of July with the aim of occupying additional lands from Azerbaijan, which resulted in death of Azerbaijani soldiers, army personnel and civilians. An elderly 76 years old resident of Tovuz named Aziz Azizov was killed as the result of the shelling of civilian targets by Armenia and Azerbaijani-Hungarian Youth Union asks international community to condemn Armenia for killing civilians.As a result of these actions, Azerbaijani army had to respond to the occupation efforts within its internationally recognized borders in order to protect local civilians of Tovuz region and stop Armenia from further acts of aggression. Azerbaijani military response caused the loss of Armenian military personnel and equipment and currently, the situation remains tense in the frontline around Tovuz region.That was a totally ridiculous statement, because if Azerbaijani army personnel were the first side to attack, the used military equipment wouldn’t be UAZ car, but much stronger and devastating ones. Moreover, Azerbaijani losses were much bigger than Armenian losses when the attack started which also shows that Azerbaijan was the victim of undeclared war again. However, Azerbaijani army had to respond to these military attacks and caused heavy losses for Armenian army in the recent days. AHYU suggested that Armenia was willing to involve the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) in the conflict by creating tension at the border. However, the initiated and planned extraordinary permanent council meeting of the CSTO regarding this issue was cancelled in the end as the other member countries knew well about the intentions of Armenia. Moreover, Armenia also aims to destabilize the region and put the realization of international energy deals between Azerbaijan and Europe which harms the interest of the European Member states including Hungary. Such military escalations are especially inhumane during pandemic when most military conflicts across the world are stopped.These resolutions also reaffirm that those territories are integral part of Azerbaijan. Tovuz is not within Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding regions, therefore it seems Armenia wants to open a new military frontline with Azerbaijan.It was also noted that Azerbaijani-Hungarian relationship improved over last several years, especially trade, business opportunities and cooperation on youth level improved between two countries. There are currently hundreds of Azerbaijani people who live, work and study in Hungary and they are deeply concerned that peace in the Caucasus region is under danger. Azerbaijani community of Hungary calls the international community to demand from Armenia to stop the illegal occupation of Azerbaijan’s territories, withdraw its military troops from occupied lands and engage constructively in the conflict settlement process in accordance with the requirements of the relevant resolutions of the UN as well as the other norms and principles of international law.;A
HU;Armenian artillery shells Azerbaijani positions;On July 12, the Armenian artillery shelled the Azerbaijani positions in the Tovuz district. The Azerbaijani military responded with counterfire and prevented the advancement of the Armenian armed forces. As a result of the fire exchange, the Armenian troops failed to advance and were forced to retreat with no territorial gains. Currently, Azerbaijan’s armed forces fully control the situation on the ground. According to Xinhua, four Azerbaijani soldiers were killed in a fresh wave of clashes on the Azerbaijan-Armenia border.Three soldiers were killed on Sunday and one on Monday in artillery fire near the northern Tavush region, Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Defense said on Monday. According to the Armenian Defense Ministry, at least two Armenian police officers were wounded in the clashes. The two countries have traded accusations over which side started the fighting and violated the ceasefire.The deadly clashes were reportedly erupted on Sunday in the Tavush region between the two countries. As a member of the OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) Minsk Group co-chairs, Russia’s Foreign Ministry on Monday expressed concern in a statement over the escalation of the clashes and urged the two countries to exercise restraint.“The enemy received an adequate response yesterday and this night. Our servicemen have been avenged and we will continue to do so in the future,” said President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev at a meeting of the Security Council on Monday. “The blood of our servicemen and martyrs does not and will not remain on the ground. We will use every opportunity to defend ourselves and show the enemy its place again,” the head of state added.said Assistant to the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Head of Foreign Policy Issues Department of the Administration Hikmat Hajiyev. “The troops of the State Border Service have been deployed along the extensive part of the state border in Gazakh and Tovuz districts from Azerbaijan’s side, to prevent provocations and reduce cases that can lead to tensions on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Armenia, on the contrary, has continued to militarize the border between two countries, while deliberately and systematically targeting the civilians.”“Such military recklessness on the part of Armenia pursues an objective of drawing the military-political organizations to which it is a party to into the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, and evade the responsibility of occupation and aggression against Azerbaijan. Armenia’s aggression against Azerbaijan that has lasted for nearly 30 years and provocations perpetrated along the border also contravene the legal documents of the military-political organizations to which Armenia is a member,” he noted. Armenian defense ministry tried to deny that its troops shelled the villages, but the photos released in media prove the opposite.  In blatant violation of the UN Charter and other legal international obligations Armenia has carried out military aggression against Azerbaijan and occupied Azerbaijan’s Nagorno-Karabakh region and seven surrounding districts. The UN Security Council resolutions 822, 853, 874 and 884 demand full and unconditional withdrawal of the Armenian armed forces from the occupied territories of Azerbaijan. Hikmat Hajiyev said.   “We call upon the international community to condemn Armenia’s policy of occupation against Azerbaijan and its provocative actions perpetrated along the border. Armenia’s leadership bears full and sole responsibility for the current situation,” he added.   As a result of the Armenian shelling, serious damage was inflicted to the residential houses in the nearby settlements. Civilians were wounded, including infants, cattle killed, agricultural machinery damaged.Armenia and Azerbaijan have been at loggerheads over the mountainous region of Nagorno-Karabakh since 1988. Peace talks have been held since 1994 when a ceasefire was reached, but there have been occasional minor clashes along the borders.;A
IR;Russia-Turkey rivalry looms over Nagorno-Karabakh peace deal;An agreement to end fighting between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces over Nagorno-Karabakh sets the stage for a more intense rivalry between Russia and Turkey in the south Caucasus and beyond.Moscow deployed some 2,000 troops to Nagorno-Karabakh as the deal took effect on Tuesday. It was an operation that looked as swift and decisive as Russia’s previous efforts to end the crisis were weak and unsuccessful.Three earlier attempts to impose a Russian-brokered ceasefire failed and, while Moscow made clear that it would only assist its ally Armenia if fighting spread to its territory, Azerbaijan benefited from Ankara’s vocal political support, the firepower of its advanced drones, and the reassuring presence of Turkish fighter jets stationed at an Azeri airfield.As the Kremlin sought to preserve good ties with both ex-Soviet states, Turkey moved in lockstep with Baku in decrying three decades of negotiations mediated by Russia, France and the United States and making clear that Azerbaijan would now retake Nagorno-Karabakh by force unless Armenian troops withdrew.The restoration of Azeri control over the whole of Nagorno-Karabakh – which became a possibility this week – could have caused a humanitarian disaster for its ethnic Armenian residents. At the same time, it would have deprived Russia of much of its leverage over Armenia and Azerbaijan.By stepping in now, as signatory to a peace deal that leaves the status of core areas of Nagorno-Karabakh in question, Russia has ensured that through its peacekeepers and diplomats it retains a key role in the future of the south Caucasus and remains an important arbiter in relations between Yerevan and Baku.Without signing any deals or deploying troops, however, Turkey has also now made itself a powerful player in regional political, economic and military affairs.Azerbaijan says Turkish and Russian officers will staff a centre to monitor implementation of the peace accord. More importantly, the deal provides for a road cutting through Armenia to link most of Azerbaijan with its exclave on the Turkish border, giving Turkey a direct land corridor to all of its ally’s territory.Most significantly, perhaps, Azerbaijan and Turkey have shown that the course of a major dispute between ex-Soviet states can be changed without Kremlin approval, and with no significant EU or US involvement.Whether Russia and Turkey now co-operate or clash in the south Caucasus – at a time when they back opposing sides in war-torn Syria and Libya – will be crucial to the region’s long-term peace.;N
IR;The Irish Times view on Nagorno-Karabakh: an enforced truce;After six weeks of bloody fighting in which thousands have died, Armenia and Azerbaijan have signed a ceasefire agreement to end the war for control of the mountainous enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. It will see 2,000 Russian peacekeepers deployed in the disputed Caucasus territory.Facing substantial territorial losses, Armenia’s prime minister Nikol Pashinyan reluctantly signed a Russian-brokered deal that accepts the new reality on the ground, but he has faced an angry response in the capital Yerevan at what is alleged to be “surrender”. Pashinyan described the truce terms as “unbelievably painful” but necessary due to “a deep analysis of the military situation”. The Armenians were no match for Azeri forces equipped with an airborne fleet of Israeli and Turkish drones that has inflicted major damage on tanks, air defences and heavy weapons.The region is internationally recognised as Azerbaijani but populated by ethnic Armenians, and large districts extending from Armenia to the enclave have been controlled by Yerevan since the early 1990s. The deal guarantees a land corridor linking Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia, as well as a staggered withdrawal of Armenian forces from Azeri districts around the enclave.Baku has the strong support of Turkey, while Russia, the dominant geopolitical power in the region, sought to remain neutral. There were concerns that, unresolved, the dispute would embroil the regional powers in direct clashes.Although three earlier ceasefires collapsed, Monday’s agreement appears more likely to be sustainable in redrawing the local map in a way that restores Azerbaijan control of lost territories but leaves the enclave substantially intact with the exception of its second city Shusha which has fallen to Azeri control. But the long-term future independence of the enclave is not resolved and will remain a running sore between the two.Armenia had defied UN resolutions calling for the return of the displaced Azeri residents to the districts lost in 1994. They may now be able to go back to what are largely ghost villages.;N
IR;Armenian leader defies angry protests over Nagorno-Karabakh deal;Armenian prime minister Nikol Pashinyan has rejected calls to resign over a deal that gives Azerbaijan control over swathes of Nagorno-Karabakh, as Russian peacekeepers were deployed to the disputed region after six weeks of fighting.Thousands of angry Armenians rallied in their capital, Yerevan, on Thursday, despite the arrest of dozens of protesters and at least 10 opposition leaders during an earlier march at which they denounced the deal as “treachery” and “surrender”.The Moscow-brokered accord came into force on Tuesday, ending clashes that killed well over 1,000 people in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway region of Azerbaijan run by its ethnic Armenian majority since a war in the early 1990s.The agreement locks in major battlefield gains made by Azeri forces since they began an offensive in late September, and leaves the province’s separatist Armenian administration in charge of significantly reduced territory that will soon be patrolled by Russian peacekeepers. Critics of the pact stormed parliament in Yerevan when it was announced.Mr Pashinyan said on Thursday that he signed the deal when it became clear that several key towns, including the regional capital Stepanakert, would soon fall and “20,000 Armenian troops and officers could find themselves surrounded by enemy troops, facing the prospect of being killed or captured”.“Our priority now is to restore the atmosphere of stability and security in the country ... The government will not give in to provocations from rebel groups sponsored by the former authorities,” he added.“The organisers of the riots and many of the active participants have been arrested, many are in hiding, but they will definitely be found and brought to justice. I call on all our compatriots not to give in to provocations but to unite around a government that is determined ... to get the country out of this situation.”Elites blamedMr Pashinyan lambasted the political elites that he challenged when taking power in a peaceful 2018 revolution, blaming their rampant corruption for weakening the nation’s military. He also reassured ethnic Armenian residents of Nagorno-Karabakh that Russian peacekeepers would protect them.Moscow has started deploying 1,960 troops to the region, with armoured vehicles and helicopters, under an initial five-year mandate that includes responsibility for guarding the main road between Stepanakert and Armenia.Russia has rejected claims from Turkey that its peacekeepers will also patrol the province, as Ankara looks to convert its strong support for Azerbaijan’s military offensive into greater influence in the strategic south Caucasus.Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said Turkish and Russian officers would work together at a centre for monitoring implementation of the peace deal, which would be located on Azeri territory some distance from Nagorno-Karabakh.His Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, said Armenia must now “hand over all occupied lands . . . Azerbaijan is in favour of a peaceful solution but if Armenia insists on violating the agreement, then it will have to bear the consequences.”In Yerevan, Mr Pashinyan insisted the long-running dispute was far from over.This week’s deal “only implies cessation of hostilities”, he said. “The Nagorno-Karabakh issue was not resolved before the signing of the [agreement], nor has it been settled after it. There is still much to be done in this respect.”;A
IR;Ireland’s Armenians: ‘My home has again become a big pile of ruins’;Ten years ago Aram Hakhumyan and his wife were married in the Armenian Ghazanchetsots Cathedral in Shushi, in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region. One month ago Hakhumyan, who has lived in Ireland for seven years, woke up to the devastating news that his family’s beloved cathedral had been badly damaged during air raids in the area.“The situation is so stressful, my heart is bleeding for my people,” he told The Irish Times from his home in Celbridge, Co Kildare. “I’ve taken time off work just to be able to cope with the situation. My ancestors lived in that area for centuries. Shushi is the city of my grandparents. After the war ended in 1994 we spent 30 years rebuilding it. But now again it has just become a big pile of ruins.”Hakhumyan says his 21-year-old nephew was left in a coma after he was wounded during the initial days of the conflict over the mountain enclave. He has two brothers fighting on the frontline while his sister, he adds, lost her home in a bombing attack. More than 1,000 people, and possibly many more, have been killed since fighting erupted in late September.We are only 150,000 people living on a small plot of land in the mountains but we exist and we have the right to live and live in peaceNagorno-Karabakh, also known as Artsakh, is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but is populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians. On Saturday, Armenia and Azerbaijan again accused each other of bombing residential areas in defiance of a pact between the two countries’ foreign ministers, who met envoys from France, Russia and the United States in Geneva last week.Three attempts to implement a ceasefire between the sides have failed and Azerbaijan – backed by its chief ally, Turkey – says that by force or through diplomacy it is now determined to retake control of this breakaway region that has been run by its ethnic Armenian majority since a war in the 1990s that claimed 30,000 lives.Hakhumyan says the only people left in the region are those fighting in the conflict and elderly people who refuse to leave their homes. All the rest have fled seeking safety in Armenia. “The world must understand that this war is not about territory, religion, or anything else, it is about the very existence of people of Artsakh,” he says. “We are only 150,000 people living on a small plot of land in the mountains but we exist and we have the right to live and live in peace.”DevastatingVahe Sasunts, a 23-year-old software developer who was born and brought up in Ireland and is the child of Armenian immigrants, has lost a cousin in the conflict. Sasunts, who recently graduated from Trinity College and started his “dream job” with a large tech company, says watching the violence unfold in the region, where is mother’s family is from, is devastating. He regularly finds his mother reading the news in tears and is struggling to concentrate on his work.Vahe Sasunts, a 23-year-old software developer from Kildare, whose parents came to Ireland from Armenia“I thought I was just starting my adult life. I’d finished college, I was gonna save up and buy a house and car, and it just feels like all those things aren’t as important in my life anymore. I feel there’s a part of me that’s always worried now, always anxious, always wondering how my family are back home,” he says.With communication lines damaged in recent bombings, his family are struggling to stay in touch with loved ones in Nagorno-Karabakh. “We’re trying not to lose hope and faith, we’re just trying to support one another.”Sasunts is a member of a group of Irish-Armenians who have called on the Government to take a stronger stance on the violence. As a member of the UN Security Council, Ireland must stand up for justice in other nations, he says. “I would like to see Ireland prove that it is really believes in freedom of speech and human rights. It’s what Ireland fought for for years, and we achieved it, but we’re not advocating it for other places.”In a letter sent to the Oireachtas foreign affairs committee accompanying a petition signed by more than 1,100 people, the Irish-Armenian community said the ongoing conflict grossly violated “all the principles of human rights and international humanitarian law”.The letter, sent in early October, said further violence in the region could “potentially lead to an absolute catastrophe not only in the south Caucasus but also in the world by provoking involvement of other major countries, causing more destruction and taking more human lives”.AggressionThe group has called on Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney to condemn Azerbaijan for its aggression against the region and Turkey for its political and military involvement in the conflict.Covid-19 cases are rising, there is not enough oxygen and now they are heavily bombarding hospitals. It’s absolute catastrophe, it really is a humanitarian crisisDr Diana Minasyan, an ophthalmologist based in Cork, says the ongoing violence has reignited memories of the 1915 Armenian genocide during which nearly 1.5 million people were killed by the Ottoman Turks. Turkey’s backing of Azerbaijan’s drive to retake the mountainous province further embeds that sense of fear among Armenians worldwide, she says.Like many Armenians in Ireland, Minasyan, who has Irish citizenship and has lived here since 2002, has family in the contested region and cousins fighting on the frontline. One cousin has been left paralysed after he was hit in a cluster bomb attack, she says. And the coronavirus pandemic continues to be a real problem in the region, she adds.“Covid-19 cases are rising, there is not enough oxygen and now they are heavily bombarding hospitals. It’s absolute catastrophe, it really is a humanitarian crisis,” she says.Minasyan signed the petition sent to the Government because she fears the violence could destabilise all of the Caucasus region. She says no Armenian wants to fight but that men are taking up arms to “keep their children safe. All they want is to live their daily lives and have an ordinary life.”;E
IR;Armenians hope their fighting spirit will save them amid Nagorno-Karabakh conflict;The children are gone and only a few women remain. Stepanakert, the de facto capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, has become a city of men. The streets are quiet aside from the odd ambulance, military Jeep or Lada banger grunting along. The supermarket shelves are thinning and the menu options at the Armenia Hotel leave much to be desired.So much of this war between Azerbaijan and Armenia, which erupted on September 27th, is from another time. In the south it’s mostly trench warfare, where young men huddle in shallow narrow trenches. Decaying bodies are scattered across no man’s land – there are reports of wild pigs tearing at rotting flesh at night.In villages, families are packed on to buses and sent to Yerevan, Armenia’s capital. Some refuse to leave and retreat to a life underground. Every day brings rumours of Azeri advances, fresh propaganda and stories of loss.In Stepanakert you can talk about the war, but you cannot analyse it. The Armenians’ love for this land, and their willingness to die for it, has hindered their ability to talk about it frankly. A dark flash crosses their face when you mention Azeri gains or press for facts about strategy.They are a nation of fighters and firmly believe their fighting spirit, coupled with their advantage of having the higher ground in Nagorno-Karabakh, will save them in the end. When asked in an interview with this reporter how the Armenians can defend against Azeri drones, which have been supplied by Turkey and Israel and have inflicted heavy losses, the president of Nagorno-Karabakh, Arayik Harutyunyan, said: “This is a sacred war, and the side who fights a sacred fight, wins.”;E

In this regard, Italy wishes to highlight the importance of respecting the identity of each community, as well as the cultural and religious diversity of the area, as a prerequisite for intra-regional reconciliation. As a member of the Minsk Group, Italy guarantees its full support for the co-Chairpersons, with a view to consolidation of the ceasefire, an essential precondition for a lasting solution to the conflict. Italy will also play its part in the context of the EU, in the stabilisation and growth of the region that, besides other things, is an important hub for connectivity and energy supplies for Europe and for our own Country.;N

We strongly condemn the attacks on Ganja, as well as the indiscriminate bombing of populated areas on both sides, particularly in Stepanakert/Khankendi.We, therefore, join with the appeals of the UN Secretary-General and the international community for full respect of international humanitarian law on both sides, to put an end to any further suffering to their respective populations already sorely tried by many years of conflict.We also renew our strong hope that Armenia and Azerbaijan will once again engage in a constructive dialogue, within the negotiating framework of the Minsk Group. We strongly support the efforts made by its Co-Presidents to this end.;N
KZ;The Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan has been saved;In today's program we will focus on the victory of Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh.Heavy clashes broke out in Nagorno-Karabakh on September 27, 2020 due to the Armenian attack. After the capture of Shusha by the Azerbaijani army, Armenia was forced to accept the defeat and sign a ceasefire agreement. The tripartite agreement with Russia was signed on November 10, 2020.During the 44-day war, the Azerbaijani army rescued 7 occupied territories and 7 villages, including Shusha. The status of Nagorno-Karabakh will be clarified later. According to the agreement, Aghdam region will be liberated on November 20, Kelbezer on November 25, and Lachin on December 1. Displaced immigrants return to their homes in Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas under the auspices of the UN High Commissioner for Migration.According to Article 3 of the agreement, a total of 1,960 troops and more than 450 Russian peacekeepers are stationed on the front line in Nagorno-Karabakh and along the Lachin Corridor. The Russian peacekeeping force has been in the region for five years. Turkish and Russian Defense Ministers have signed an agreement on the establishment of Turkish-Russian monitoring centers to monitor the ceasefire.Article 9 of this agreement provides for the opening of a corridor connecting the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic to Azerbaijan. Thus, Turkey is connected with Azerbaijan and the Central Asian region by land. Once the Kars-Igdyr-Nakhichevan railway project is completed, the next step will be the construction of a railway connecting Nakhichevan to Baku.After the agreement, Armenia was in turmoil. Protesters in Yerevan are demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan. Security and surveillance forces also jailed the opposition on suspicion of plotting a coup.During the war, more than 100 civilians were killed in Azerbaijan due to Armenian attacks. Armenia has attacked civilians and committed war and inhumane crimes.The burning and destruction of houses, schools and forests by Armenians fleeing the occupied territories in accordance with the agreement showed that they did not accept this land as their homeland. On the contrary, when Azerbaijanis were expelled from the region in 1994, they believed that one day they would return home with the keys to their homes. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev has said that Armenia should pay for the damage it has done to the occupied territories.The Prosecutor General's Office of Azerbaijan has launched an investigation into members of the PKK / PYD / YPG terrorist organization who came to Nagorno-Karabakh from Syria, Lebanon and Iraq to fight the Azerbaijani army. The dreams of the imperialist powers to turn Karabakh into a hotbed of terror have come to naught. At the end of the war, it became clear that the main power in the region was Turkey and Russia, and that Western countries had lost their old forces in the region.The victory of Nagorno-Karabakh glorified the faith of the Turkic world. In time, other Turkish territories will be liberated. Attempts to unite the Turkic world will accelerate from now on.;A
KZ;Kazakh Foreign Ministry makes official statement on Nagorno-Karabakh conflict;The 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire agreement has been signed. Kazakh Foreign Ministry made a statement on the Nagorno-Karabakh peace deal, stating that Kazakhstan highly appreciates the agreements reached between Armenia and Azerbaijan. They correspond to the resolutions of the UN Security Council and can serve as the basis for resolving the problem in the area.“We particularly note the constructive role of the Russian Federation in reaching this agreement and its peacemaking efforts aimed at practical implementation of the agreements. We express our hope that, in this difficult period, Azerbaijani and Armenian peoples will strive to build a solid foundation for establishing lasting peace and harmony and ensuring security in the region,” said the official statement.In a joint statement announced by President of Russia Vladimir Putin, it is reported that the parties agreed on a complete ceasefire and cessation of hostilities from November 10, 2020.Armenia and Azerbaijan stopped at their occupied positions, while Russian peacekeepers were brought to Nagorno-Karabakh to bolster truce.;N

KZ;Tokayev Addresses CSTO Council Meeting, Praises Russian Peace Deal With Armenia and Azerbaijan;Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev participated in the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) Council meeting that gathered Dec. 2 via videoconference, reported Akorda press service.The Collective Security Treaty was signed May 15, 1992 in Tashkent, Uzbekistan by the heads of Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, In 1993, it was joined by Azerbaijan, Belarus and Georgia and in 1994, the treaty evolved to become a fully-fledged international organization. Currently, it consists of six members –  Armenia, Belarus Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and TajikistanThe CSTO virtual meeting was attended by Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus, Vladimir Putin of Russia, Emomali Rahmon of Tajikistan, acting President of Kyrgyzstan Talant Mamytov and Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan as well as CSTO Secretary General Stanislav Zas. CSTO heads of states discussed international and regional security issues, summed up the work in the CSTO priority areas this year and outlined future plans. Russia transferred the chairmanship in the organization to Tajikistan for 2021. The leaders also focused on practical measures to counteract current challenges and threats, combat terrorism, drug trafficking, and cybersecurity risks.Addressing the meeting, Tokayev expressed his gratitude to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who chaired the session, for the organization of the council meeting. In his remarks on regional and global security, Tokayev noted the escalating tensions between states and commended Russia’s role as a mediator in the Nagorno Karabakh conflict.“I believe the agreement reached with the participation of Russia is the only right solution in this critical situation and this agreement will contribute to long-term peace in the region. This is indeed a historic agreement,” he said. The continuing turmoil in global politics and the economy caused by the coronavirus pandemic is exacerbated by mutual sanctions, restrictions and trade wars, said Tokayev. “The growth of new global challenges and threats related to extremism and terrorism, drug trafficking, cybersecurity and illegal migration, remains a concern. Under these conditions, the role of the CSTO is growing as an effective mechanism of interstate cooperation to strengthen peace, security and stability in the vast region,” said Akorda press service. During the meeting, Tokayev proposed creating a new position within the CSTO – Special Representative of CSTO Secretary General on Peacebuilding. Kazakhstan’s participation in the CSTO, he noted, is a top priority in the country’s foreign policy. “I am glad that the CSTO has increased its presence in international politics and plays a crucial role in ensuring security on a large part of the Eurasian continent. We are ready, as previously, to actively cooperate with our partners to seek effective solutions to ensure peace, security, and prosperity of our people,” he said.Upon the end of the meeting, the CSTO leaders adopted the Declaration of the Collective Security Council and the Statement on the formation of just and sustainable world order as well as 15 other documents, including a military cooperation agreement for 2021-2025, civil service training, and on the organization’s budget plan. The documents adopted at the session are aimed at further strengthening the CSTO activities, and demonstrate the openness of the organization towards expanding cooperation with other countries and international organizations.;N

Images of his trip were shown on state television on Tuesday.According to Aliyev, Armenians living in the region will be granted the same rights as other Azerbaijani citizens.""All citizens of Azerbaijan, representing different nations and religions, live in conditions of peace and good neighborliness.The Armenian people will also live in these conditions, ""said the Azerbaijani leader.He added that Baku considers the Armenians of Karabakh to be its citizens.The situation in Nagorno-Karabakh was complicated on 27 September, when active fighting broke out in the disputed area.November 9 Russian President Vladimir Putin, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian have signed a joint statement on a complete cessation of hostilities in Nagorno-Karabakh.The Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh began in February 1988, when the Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region declared its withdrawal from the Azerbaijani SSR.In September 1991, the establishment of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic was announced at the Autonomous Administrative Center of Stepanakert.In the wake of the military conflict, Azerbaijan lost control of Nagorno-Karabakh.";A

LU;Deal to end fighting between Armenia, Azerbaijan;Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said he’s signed an agreement to end the war over Nagorno-Karabakh, just days after Azerbaijani forces captured a key strategic city in the contested region.“I made that decision as a result of a deep analysis of the military situation,” he wrote in a Facebook post early Tuesday, calling it “an extremely difficult decision.”“It’s not a victory,” he wrote. “But there’s no defeat unless you consider yourself to be the loser.”The deal was signed with the leaders of Russia and Azerbaijan and takes effect immediately. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the agreement would be the basis for long-term stability in the war-torn region and called for the deployment of peacekeepers, adding that Azerbaijani and Armenian troops will halt at their current positions, according to a Kremlin statement.Russia’s Defense Ministry said it’s deploying almost 2,000 peacekeepers and 90 armored personnel carriers to Nagorno-Karabakh following the accord to halt the war, the Interfax news service reported early Tuesday.Turkish forces will also be deployed in Nagorno-Karabakh as peacekeepers, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said in an address to the nation, the Tass news service reported.The agreement reached by the three leaders doesn’t mention Turkish peacekeepers, however. It sets out a timetable for Armenian withdrawal from occupied Azerbaijani districts outside Nagorno-Karabakh in stages by Dec. 1, and guarantees a transport corridor linking the enclave to Armenia, protected by Russian troops, according to Russia’s state-run Sputnik news service.Hundreds of protesters took to the streets of the Armenian capital, Yerevan, after Pashinyan’s announcement. Demonstrators broke into the parliament and others gathered outside the govenrment building and the prime minister’s house, according to Interfax.The two sides have been fighting for more than six weeks over the enclave and surrounding regions, which are internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan but were taken by Armenia in a bloody war in the early 1990s. More than 5,000 people have been killed in the latest round of fighting, according to Russian officials.Azerbaijani AdvanceAliyev, backed by Turkey, vowed to retake the territory and on Sunday announced that his forces had retaken the key city of Shusha, known as Shushi in Armenian, a strategic highland above Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh’s capital. The government there, backed by Armenia, had warned that the loss of Shushi would lead to the fall of the entire region.“We have won this victory on the battlefield, not at the negotiating table,” Aliyev said in a televised speech on Sunday. “I have said many times that, despite all the statements, there are military solutions to this conflict.”Late Monday, Baku apologized for shooting down a Russian military helicopter over Armenia, killing two. Russia’s Foreign Ministry welcomed the speedy apology and called for a full investigation. Moscow has a military base in Armenia and the two countries have a mutual-defense pact, but Russia also has close relations with Azerbaijan.Prior to the fighting that erupted Sept. 27, Armenian forces controlled Nagorno-Karabakh and seven surrounding districts of Azerbaijan as a buffer zone. A Russia-brokered truce in 1994 halted a war that had killed 30,000 and displaced 1 million amid the collapse of the Soviet Union. International mediators led by France, Russia and the U.S. have tried without success for nearly three decades to negotiate a peace deal.Azerbaijan says it’s fighting to restore control over its internationally recognized territory. Armenia says it’s defending Nagorno-Karabakh’s right to self-determination after its Armenian majority voted for independence.Three attempts by Russia, France and the U.S. since Oct. 10 to restore a cease-fire failed to take hold. In contrast to previous outbreaks of fighting, Russia has struggled to rein in the warring sides in its former Soviet backyard, partly because of active support given to Aliyev’s military campaign from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.;A

""Our response will be proportional, and full responsibility is on the military-political leadership of Azerbaijan,"" he said.About 10 Armenian serviceman have been killed in the fighting, said Samvel Babayan, secretary of the Nagorno-Karabakh Security Council, according to Radio Liberty.The conflict comes after tensions between the two sides rose sharply last week, when Aliyev alleged that Armenia was massing forces near Nagorno-Karabakh for a new war. Armenia dismissed the claim as groundless and accused Aliyev of preparing for a war.As the fighting raged, Facebook and other social media appeared blocked in Azerbaijan and internet access was slow in some areas.""Armenia is occupying our territory,"" Aliyev said in his speech. “We'll put an end to this occupation.""";A

LU;Protesters draw attention to heavy fighting in Caucasus;"Armenians and their sympathisers gathered in Luxembourg City on Tuesday to protest against the war in the disputed Caucasus mountain region of Nagorno-Karabakh, which has flared up in the past weeks.About 70 people met in the Place d'Armes, speaking out against Turkey's role in the fighting over the enclave inside Azerbaijan, which is inhabited by Armenians, and which the two countries have been at loggerheads over for more than three decades.The latest hostilities, the worst since Nagorno-Karabakh broke away from Baku, have also heightened tensions between Russia and Turkey, as Istanbul openly supports Azerbaijan's attempt to reclaim its territory.Over the weekend, Armenian forces bombarded Azerbaijan's second city, Ganja, in retaliation for attacks on Stepanakert, the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, which has been hit by shelling for over a week. The two sides have accused each other of using cluster munition, which is banned by international treaties, and at least 240 people have so far been killed - although the actual death toll including civilians may be much higher.Last week France, Russia and the US, members of the Minsk group that has overseen peacemaking attempts since 1992, called for an immediate ceasefire. The Armenian government said it was willing to engage in talks, but Ilham Aliyev, the Azerbaijani president, said Armenian forces had to withdraw before a dialogue could begin.Moscow and Ankara also back opposing sides in the civil wars in Libya and Syria. Russia has a military base in Armenia and a mutual defence pact with the country, though that does not cover the disputed territory.Both Moscow and Paris have accused Erdogan of sending mercenary fighters from Syria to Azerbaijan, but Baku has denied that any ""irregular forces"" are assisting its troops.French President Emmanuel Macron said his country had evidence that Syrian jihadists had travelled from the Turkish city of Gaziantep, close to the Syrian border, to fight in Nagorno-Karabakh.";E
LU;Azerbaijan hoists flag in Lachin, third district surrendered by Armenia;"Azerbaijani soldiers raised their flag for the first time in almost 30 years on Tuesday in Lachin, the last of three districts surrendered by Armenia under the ceasefire that ended six weeks of fighting in Nagorno Karabakh.Shortly after midnight, an Azerbaijani military column entered the district, which had been under the control of Armenian forces since a war in the 1990s that left tens of thousands dead and hundreds of thousands displaced.AFP journalists then saw a group of ten soldiers participate in a ceremony in the courtyard of an official building in the city, above which was hoisted the Azerbaijani flag.The district of Lachin, like that of Aghdam surrendered on November 20 and that of Kalbajar surrendered on November 25, formed a buffer zone surrounding the self-proclaimed Republic of Nagorny Karabakh, with a majority Armenian.Four other districts with the same function had already been taken over by Baku during the six weeks of deadly fighting that erupted in the fall. All of them had escaped Azerbaijani control since the end of the war in 1994.Running along the eastern border of Armenia, from north to south to Iran, the Lachin district is best known for the corridor of the same name, now controlled by Russian peacekeepers, and became the only road linking Nagorno Karabakh to Armenia.- ""New reality"" -The residents hadn't waited to leave the area, destroying and boning their homes. However, some have chosen to stay, like Levon Gevorguian, owner of a grocery store-bar in the main square of Latchin.""I've been here for 22 years, I started from scratch, I built everything,"" says the 48-year-old. ""I hope I can continue,"" he adds.Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev greeted him on Tuesday as a ""new reality"", in a televised address to the nation. ""We have driven the enemy from our lands. We have restored territorial integrity. We have ended the occupation,"" he said.According to Mr. Aliyev, around 50,000 Azerbaijanis lived in Lachin district before the war of the 1990s and they will return there ""in the near future"".In Baku, the capital, the streets were overrun with residents waving the national flag to celebrate Latchin's handover, according to an AFP journalist.In Yerevan, the Armenian capital, dozens of people protested against such Armenian concessions, briefly blocking streets, while others marched demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian and calling him a ""traitor"".- ""Ambiguous"" status quo -For Olessia Vartanian, analyst for the International Crisis Group, the surrender of the latter district is proof that the ceasefire agreement ""works"". But the new status quo is ""unclear,"" she warns.""The agreement obtained by Moscow is very precise as regards the surrender of the territories, but it is ambiguous on a number of aspects such as the mandate of the Russian peace forces and the organization of the life of the local population, Armenians and Azerbaijanis alike, ”she told AFP.In the meantime, many residents of Nagorny Karabakh who had fled the recent fighting have started to resettle in the breakaway region. On Tuesday, the Russian military said it had so far assisted in the return of more than 26,000 people.The ceasefire of November 9, signed when the military situation was catastrophic for Armenia, enshrines the victory of Azerbaijan and grants it important territorial gains.It nevertheless allows the survival of Nagorno Karabakh, diminished, and sees the deployment of 2,000 Russian peacekeepers.Signed under Russian patronage, the cease-fire recalled the determining role of Moscow in its Caucasian precinct but also showed the growing influence of Turkey, support of Baku.Turkey also announced on Tuesday an agreement with Russia on the establishment of a joint observation center whose mission will be to monitor the ceasefire in Nagorny Karabakh.Conversely, the Western countries seem to be losing ground and neither France nor the United States, mediators as members of the ""Minsk group"" charged in the 1990s with finding a lasting solution to the crisis.

This is the sharpest conflict since the 90s. It is clear that there is currently an active emotional phase in which it is difficult to determine who has invested more in the conflict and who less,” said Rinkēvičs.Therefore, there are calls to de-escalate the situation and to sit down for negotiation. Rinkēvičs pointed out that such conflicts are referred to as “frozen”. “There is a ceasefire, an outbreak, then soldiers and civilians fall. Then we all call on them again, condemn, but structurally, be it Karabakh or Transnistria, there is nothing going on,” the Minister said.Rinkēvičs stressed that there are big players who want to keep the current situation. ""While there is peace, other countries' problems are in the news. Unfortunately, it is much easier to create these conflicts than to resolve them,” said the Minister.The Latvian Foreign Minister said that Russia played a rather serious role in the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. “It is disappointing that Russia supplies weapons to both countries. We do not see [Russia's] desire to address the situation,” said Rinkēvičs.";N

He said his army would ""take revenge on the battlefield"" and promised to capture Karabakh by driving out Armenian forces ""like dogs"".'Our pain is deep'As the sun rose over the devastation in Ganja, Mayil Shakhnazarov, 36, said it was impossible to identify some of those killed.""What can we say? Our pain is deep. Really deep,"" he told AFP.The seeming tit-fot-tat attacks further undermine international efforts to calm a resurgence of fighting between Christian Armenians and Muslim Azerbaijanis and avoid drawing regional powers Russia and Turkey into a conflict that has killed hundreds of people.An AFP team in Ganja saw rows of houses in Ganja turned to rubble by the strike, which shattered walls and ripped roofs off buildings in the surrounding streets.People ran outside in shock and tears, stumbling through dark muddy alleys in their slippers, some wearing bathroom robes and pyjamas.'Everything shattered' The EU condemned the strike on Ganja and said a ceasefire agreed between Armenia and Azerbaijan in Moscow last week ""must be fully respected without delay"".""The European Union deplores the strikes on the Azerbaijani city of Ganja during the night of 16-17 October resulting in civilian loss of life and serious injury,' said a spokesperson for EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell""All targeting of civilians and civilian installations by either party must stop.""The attack came six days after a missile struck another residential part of the city of more than 300,000 people, killing 10 civilians and leaving many on edge.At the scene of the latest strike, Durdana Mammadova, 69, was standing on the street at daybreak because her house was destroyed.

Baku said that an Azerbaijani family of five were killed in shelling launched by Armenian separatists.A major confrontation between Muslim Azerbaijan and majority Christian Armenia threatened to embroil regional players Moscow and Ankara and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan called on global powers to prevent Turkey from getting involved in the conflict.""We are on the brink of a full-scale war in the South Caucasus,"" Pashinyan warned.Azerbaijan's ""authoritarian regime has once again declared war on the Armenian people"", he added.France, Germany and the EU swiftly urged an ""immediate ceasefire,"" while Pope Francis prayed for peace.Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the military flareup with Pashinyan and called for ""an end to hostilities"".""The Russian side expressed serious concern over the resumption of large-scale clashes,"" the Kremlin said.But Azerbaijan's ally Turkey blamed Yerevan for the flare-up and promised Baku its ""full support"".""The Turkish people will support our Azerbaijani brothers with all our means as always,"" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan tweeted.Azerbaijan accused Armenian forces of violating a ceasefire, saying it had launched a counter-offensive to ""ensure the safety of the population"", using tanks, artillery missiles, combat aviation and drones.Azerbaijan imposed martial law and a curfew in large cities and said it had captured from Armenian rebels a strategic mountain that helps control transport communications between Yerevan and the Armenian-held enclave.- 'Sacred homeland' -In a televised address to the nation earlier Sunday, Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev vowed victory over Armenian forces.""Our cause is just and we will win,"" he said, echoing a famous quote from Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin's address at the outbreak of World War II in Russia.""Karabakh is Azerbaijan,"" he said. Both Armenia and Karabakh declared martial law and military mobilisation.""Get ready to defend our sacred homeland,"" Pashinyan said on Facebook.Armenia said that Azerbaijan attacked civilian settlements in Nagorny Karabakh including the main city Stepanakert.Pashinyan's wife, Anna Hakobyan, said that she had travelled to a hospital in Stepanakert to be with her Karabakh ""brothers and sisters"".Azerbaijan's foreign ministry said there were reports of dead and wounded. ""Extensive damage has been inflicted on many homes and civilian infrastructure,"" it said.Karabakh's rights ombudsman Artak Beglaryan pointed to ""civilian casualties,"" while Armenia said a woman and child were killed.- 'War is resuming' - Ethnic Armenian separatists seized the Nagorny Karabakh region from Baku in a 1990s war that claimed 30,000 lives.Talks to resolve one of the worst conflicts to emerge from the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union have been largely stalled since a 1994 ceasefire agreement.France, Russia and the United States have mediated peace efforts as the ""Minsk Group"" but the last big push for a peace deal collapsed in 2010.Pope Francis told crowds on Saint Peter's Square he was praying for peace and called for ""concrete gestures of good will and fraternity"" from the warring sides.Political observers said global powers should intensify talks to stop the conflict.""We are a step away from a large-scale war,"" Olesya Vartanyan of the International Crisis Group told AFP.""One of the main reasons for the current escalation is a lack of any proactive international mediation between the sides for weeks,"" she added.""War is resuming. Time for Russia, France and US, individually and jointly, to stop it,"" tweeted Dmitry Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Centre.- 'Turkish mercenaries' - Karabakh separatist leader, Arayik Harutyunyan, accused Ankara of sending mercenaries to Azerbaijan.On Sunday morning, Azerbaijan started ""active bombing"" along Karabakh's frontline including civilian targets and in Stepanakert, Karabakh's presidency said.The rebel defence ministry said its troops shot down four Azerbaijani helicopters and 15 drones, while Baku denied the claim. In July, heavy clashes along the two countries' shared border -- hundreds of kilometres from Karabakh -- claimed the lives of at least 17 soldiers from both sides.Raising the stakes, Azerbaijan at the time threatened to strike Armenia's atomic power station if Yerevan attacked strategic facilities.During the worst recent clashes in April 2016, around 110 people were killed.";N
MK;Heavy shelling and civilian casualties dash hopes for Karabakh ceasefire;"Hopes that a Russian-brokered ceasefire between Armenia and Azerbaijan might hold were further dashed Sunday, with both sides accusing the other of intense shelling on civilian areas and escalating two weeks of fierce clashes.Azerbaijan's foreign ministry said that overnight shelling by Armenian forces on the country's second largest city, Ganja, had left seven people dead and 33 wounded including children, less than 24 hours after the halt to fighting was supposed to take effect.Rescuers in red helmets dug through piles of debris with their bare hands in search of signs of survivors, an AFP journalist in the city reported.They retrieved one nearly naked body and gingerly put it in a white bag to be taken away in an ambulance while several horrified residents watched on and wept.One witness said they were woken by a huge blast that levelled an entire square block of one- and two-floor houses in the early hours of the morning, leaving nine apartments destroyed.""Everything I've worked for my entire life has been destroyed,"" said resident Zagit Aliyev, 68.The agreement to pause hostilities in order to exchange prisoners and the bodies of people killed after two weeks of fighting over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region was approved by Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers in marathon Russia-brokered talks in Moscow.- 'An absolute lie' -The truce officially entered into force at noon on Saturday but both sides almost immediately accused each other of violations.On Sunday, the defence ministry in the breakaway region insisted Armenian forces were respecting the humanitarian ceasefire and in turn accused Azerbaijan of shelling civilian-populated areas. Claims that Armenian forces were responsible for shelling Ganja were ""an absolute lie,"" it added.The leader of the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, Arayik Harutyunyan, described the situation as ""calmer"" on Sunday, but warned that the truce was precarious.An AFP journalist in the administrative capital of Stepanakert, which has been subjected to heavy bombings since the fighting erupted and is pockmarked with deep craters and unexploded ordnance, reported hearing loud explosions throughout the night.Vahram Poghosyan, a spokesman for Karabakh's leader, said the overnight shelling on Stepanakert was ""a disrespect of the agreements reached in Moscow,"" and called on the international community to recognise the province's independence as a way to end the fighting.New fighting broke out late last month, stemming from a long-simmering disagreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Karabakh.The disputed territory is an ethnic Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan, home to about 150,000 people, which broke from Azerbaijan's control in a war in the 1990s that killed some 30,000 people. Its separatist government is strongly backed by Armenia, which like Azerbaijan gained independence with the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. - A 'temporary' ceasefire -The most recent bout of fighting has been the heaviest since the 1990s war, with more than 450 people reported dead, thousands forced to flee their homes and fears the fighting could escalate into a devastating all-out conflict.The return of fighting has stoked fears of a full-blown war embroiling Turkey, which strongly backs Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a military treaty with Armenia.Armenia and world leaders including Russian leader Vladimir Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron have denounced the deployment of pro-Turkish fighters from Syria and Libya to bolster Azerbaijan's army.France, Russia and the US -- known as the ""Minsk Group"" -- have for decades sought a lasting solution to the Karabakh conflict, but have failed to stop sporadic outbreaks of fighting, and Baku with Turkey's backing appears set on continuing with its military intervention.A senior Azerbaijani official said Saturday the truce was only meant to be ""temporary,"" and said Baku had ""no intention to backtrack"" on its effort to retake control of Karabakh.";N
MK;Missile kills 12 in Azerbaijan city, escalating Karabakh conflict;"A missile strike levelled a row of homes in Azerbaijan's city of Ganja on Saturday, killing 12 and injuring more than 40 people in their sleep in a sharp escalation of the conflict over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region.The attack, which saw a second missile strike another part of Ganja and a third reach the nearby strategic city of Mingecevir, came hours after Azerbaijani forces shelled the ethnic Armenian separatist region's capital Stepanakert.The seeming tit-for-tat attacks further undermine international efforts to calm a resurgence of fighting between Christian Armenians and Muslim Azerbaijanis before it draws in regional powers Russia and Turkey.An AFP team in Ganja saw rows of houses turned to rubble by the strike, which shattered the walls and ripped the roofs off buildings in the surrounding streets.People ran outside in shock and tears, stumbling through dark muddy alleys in their slippers, some wearing bathroom robes and pyjamas.Second attackThe attack came only six days after a missile struck another residential part of the city of more than 300,000 people, killing 10 civilians and leaving many on edge.At the scene of the latest strike, exploding shells rumbled in the distance as rescuers and red helmets used sniffer dogs to search for signs on life.""We were sleeping. The kids were watching TV,"" Rubaba Zhafarova, 65, said in front of her destroyed home.""All the houses around here are destroyed. Many people are under the rubble. Some are dead, some are wounded.""Hikmat Hajiyev, an assistant to Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev, tweeted that according to ""initial information, more than 20 houses were destroyed"" on Saturday.Nagorno-Karabakh's military said Azerbaijani forces had stepped up their attacks on Friday across the front, shelling Stepanakert and the nearby town of Susi.The separatists ""carried out equivalent operations to stop adversary fire,"" they said in a statement released by the Armenian government.Passports, keys, braceletsRescuers periodically called for silence so they could hear the sounds of survivors as the hours passed, pulling passports, keys, bracelets and items of clothing from the debris.They called in sniffer dogs and watered down the suffocating columns of dust with hoses from a fire truck.""One woman was missing her feet. Someone else was missing an arm at the elbow,"" said Elmir Shirinzaday, 26, in a visible state of shock.Rescuers struggled to lift heavy boulders of rubble in search of signs of life, periodically taking breaks to try and calm distraught victims.""My wife was there, my wife was there,"" one man cried inconsolably while being walked toward an ambulance by a paramedic.At around the same time in the city of Mingecevir, an hour's drive north of Ganja, AFP heard the impact of a huge blast that shook buildings.Mingecevir is protected by a missile defence system because it is home to a strategic dam, and it was not immediately clear if the missile was destroyed in the air or had made impact.The defence ministry said Mingecevir had come ""under fire"", but provided no other immediate details.An Azerbaijani official said that another missile hit a separate, industrial district of Ganja at around the same time.There were no immediate details about that attack.Decades-long conflictThe decades-long Nagorno-Karabakh conflict re-erupted on September 27 and has so far killed more than 700 people, including nearly 80 civilians.The mountainous western region of Azerbaijan has remained under separatist Armenian control since a 1994 ceasefire ended a brutal war that killed 30,000.Armenia, which backs Nagorno-Karabakh but does not recognise its independence, has admitted that Azerbaijani forces have made important gains along the front in the past week.An AFP team was taken by the Azerbaijani military on Friday to one settlement re-captured in the southern section of the conflict zone near the Iranian border.Azerbaijani officials said they last controlled the settlement of Jabrayil, which includes strategic heights overlooking a fertile valley, during the post-Soviet war.The current escalation is the deadliest and longest since that six-year conflict.The shelling of Stepanakert and the strikes on the two Azerbaijani cities followed a joint call from Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday to ""end the bloodshed as soon as possible"".";A
MK;Armenians bid ‘painful’ farewell to monastery ceded in peace deal;Mourners drift through the monastery nestled in a deep mountain gorge by the dozens with loss, disbelief and sometimes tears marking their faces.The Dadivank church complex in the rugged and elevated Kalbajar region is due to be returned to Azerbaijan on Sunday by Armenian separatists who suffered a humiliating defeat after more than six weeks of intense fighting over the disputed province of Nagorno-Karabakh.The combat ended earlier this week after Armenia agreed to cede swathes of territory it had held since a war in the 1990s as part of a Russian-brokered peace deal.With its high mountain peaks, steep and forested slopes, the Kalbajar district home to the Dadivank church complex beloved by Armenians is emptying before it is returned to Azerbaijan’s control.Believed to be founded around the 12th century, Dadivank has outlived centuries of unrest and remains a majestic complex of stone and a pride of the Armenian Apostolic Church. “It’s very hard, very painful. We have come to say goodbye,” a 40-year-old visitor told AFP, hiding tears behind large sunglasses.The clusters of people who have come to see the hillside monastery for possibly the last time wander in contemplation through the central stone clearing and between the basilica and the chapel.Several wilting roses lie on the tomb of Saint Dadi who is recorded as having founded the monastery.A small kiosk inside the church is already packing up unsold candles and carrying out final transactions.The scenes at the monastery, including the rush of cars packing the small road to its base, resemble a flood of tourists on vacation except for the palpable sense of sadness and bewilderment. ‘I can’t leave’“I can’t believe this is the last time I’ll be here,” said Miasnik Simonyan, 28, from Vardenis in northern Armenia.“This is the land of our grandparents. These stones are 800 years old,” he said, gesturing to two intricately engraved traditional Armenian crosses. Inna Tumanyan, who just graduated from university in the Armenian capital Yerevan, had hoped for months to be baptised at the monastery. “But there was corona, then the war,” she told AFP. “When I heard we were going to have to give up Dadivank, I called the priest. He told me to come,” Tumanyan said.She is among 12 young women to be hastily baptised on Friday in the small Holy Mother of God church. Standing beneath two 13th century frescoes Father Hovhannes speaks bitterly of Azerbaijan, a majority-Muslim country and longstanding rival of Armenia, which he said “does not have the same values as us”. On Wednesday, the Armenian government said it was “extremely concerned” about the fate of this unique heritage, despite assurances from Baku which promises to preserve all historical and spiritual places. “People have lost loved ones, their homes. They do not want to lose Dadivank,” Father Hovhannes, with a long grey bread and a silver crucifix around his neck, told AFP.“We must pray for the protection of our monastery,” he added, noting the authorities in Yerevan have yet to give instructions on how best safeguard the site and its artefacts.“This monastery belongs to us. I can’t leave,” he says. Asked whether he planned to organise the return of the precious carved crosses to Yerevan, he says: “who am I to remove stones that have been here for over 800 years.” ;E

MO;Moldova does not recognize so-called ''presidential and parliamentary elections'' in Nagorno-Karabakh region;The Foreign Affairs and European Integration Ministry (MAEIE) describes as illegal the holding of the so-called ‘’presidential and parliamentary elections’’ in the Nagorno-Karabakh region on 31 March 2020, taking into account that they run counter the fundamental norms and principles of the international law, laid down in the UN Charter and the Helsinki Final Act, the MAEIE press service has reported.     Moldova does not recognize these pseudo-elections as such, in the context of the process of negotiations under the OSCE’s aegis on the identification of a special status for the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which might lead to the peaceful settlement of the conflict in this region.   In the context, MAEIE reiterates Moldova’s willingness to further back the efforts of the international community, especially of the OSCE Minsk Group and its co-heads, for the peaceful political and comprehensive settlement of the conflict around the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which will be able to efficiently contribute to the strengthening of peace and security in South Caucasus.;A

MT;Malta Condemns Violence In Nagorno-Karabakh, Supports De-Escalation Attempts In Eastern Med;Malta has reiterated its support to de-escalation attempts in the Eastern Mediterranean. At a meeting for Foreign and European Affairs in Luxembourg, Foreign Minister Evarist Bartolo urged all parties to respect international law, UNSC resolutions and UN ceasefire agreements, and to desist from any actions that will heighten further tensions and undermine attempts at restarting talks between all sides.Minister for Foreign and European Affairs Evarist Bartolo participated in the Foreign Affairs Ministers’ meeting in Luxembourg.Ministers had a long list on their agenda, including the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, the political situation in Belarus, the Belgrade-Pristina Dialogue, Russia and the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean, amongst others. Ministers also addressed the political challenges currently prevalent in different regions, notably the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and the political situation in Belarus. Despite the recent ceasefire agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the weekend, the fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh has intensified.Minister Bartolo strongly condemned the violence and urged both sides to accept an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. The Russian-brokered ceasefire, aimed at allowing the sides to swap prisoners and bodies of those killed, is buckling, dimming peace prospects after deadly clashes broke out on Sept. 27..Azerbaijan’s defence ministry said Armenian forces were shelling the Azeri territories of Goranboy and Aghdam, as well as Terter, and “grossly violating the humanitarian truce”.“Azeri armed forces are not violating the humanitarian ceasefire,” defence ministry spokesman Vagif Dargiahly said.The Foreign Affairs Ministers adopted conclusions on Belarus and reiterated that the elections held in Belarus were neither free nor fair, and that Alexander Lukashenko lacks democratic legitimacy.The Council called for an end to violence and agreed to scale down bilateral cooperation with Belorussian authorities while pledging support for the Belorussian people and civil society. The Foreign Affairs Council tasked the Council’s Working Group Relex to continue working on the Franco-German initiative regarding the poisoning of Alexander Navalny.

MT;Armenia Declares No-Fly Zone In Armenia And Nagorno-Karabakh;The Armenian defence ministry declared a no-fly zone in Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, except for military aircraft, Russia’s Interfax news agency reported on Thursday.Thousands of protesters on Wednesday gathered in Armenia’s capital, Yerevan, demanding Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan step down over a ceasefire that secured territorial advances for Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh, the subject of six weeks of fighting.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Thursday diplomats from France and the United States were expected in Moscow soon to discuss the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.Russia has brokered a ceasefire that secured territorial advances for Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh, where Azeri troops have been battling ethnic Armenian forces over the past six weeks.The accord, which also envisages the stationing of Russian peacekeeping troops in Nagorno-Karabakh has triggered protests in Armenia for the resignation of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan.Moscow co-chairs an international group overseeing the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute with Washington and Paris, but the latter were not involved in the ceasefire deal, which was signed between Russia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.Turkey, which has backed Azerbaijan over the conflict, signed a protocol with Russia on Wednesday to establish a joint centre to coordinate efforts to monitor the peace deal, agreed after three previous ceasefire attempts quickly broke down.The details of the monitoring have yet to be worked out and Turkish and Russian officials are due to meet in Ankara on Friday to discuss them.;E
MT;Humanitarian Crisis Feared In Nagorno-Karabak;Armenia and Azerbaijan continue to accuse each other of violating a ceasefire agreed three days ago to quell fighting over the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave, drawing warnings from international groups of a humanitarian crisis.The Russia-brokered truce is buckling despite mounting calls from world powers to halt the fighting, with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo among those urging greater commitment to the ceasefire terms.Turkey and Armenia exchanged recriminations, each blaming the other for exacerbating the crisis around Nagorno-Karabakh, which is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but governed and populated by ethnic Armenians.Azerbaijan accused Armenia of “grossly violating the humanitarian truce”, which was agreed on Saturday to allow the sides to swap prisoners and bodies of those killed.Defence Ministry spokesman Vagif Dargiahly said Armenia was shelling the Azeri territories of Goranboy and Aghdam, as well as Terter. Azeri forces were not violating the truce, he added.Armenian Defence Ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan denied the accusation. She said Azerbaijan had resumed military operations “supported by active artillery fire in the southern, northern, northeastern and eastern directions”.The fighting, which erupted on Sept. 27, is the worst since a 1991-94 war over Nagorno-Karabakh that killed about 30,000 people. It is being closely watched abroad because of fears Russia and Turkey could get sucked in. Russia has a defence pact with Armenia, while Turkey is allied with Azerbaijan.“CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES”Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan accused Turkey of muscling its way into the South Caucasus region to further what he called its expansionist ambitions. Turkey denies this.“The problem is that Armenians in the South Caucasus are the last remaining obstacle on its path to implement that expansionist policy,” Pashinyan told Reuters.The “Minsk Group” – a committee set up by the OSCE security watchdog to help mediate in Nagorno-Karabakh – called on the Armenian and Azeri leaders to implement the ceasefire to prevent “catastrophic consequences for the region”.The 11-member group is led by the United States, Russia and France. Turkey is also a member but not involved in the Nagorno-Karabakh talks, though it has said it wants to join them.Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, told reporters that while ceasefire demands were “reasonable”, the international community should ask Armenia to withdraw from Azeri territory.“Sadly no such call is being made,” he said.DEAD AND WOUNDEDThe death toll continues to rise. Nagorno-Karabakh officials said 532 servicemen had been killed so far, up 7 from Monday.Azerbaijan has reported 42 Azeri civilian deaths and 206 wounded since Sept. 27. It has not disclosed military casualties.Martin Schuepp, Eurasia regional director for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), said his organisation was trying to facilitate handovers of detainees or dead bodies, but the security situation hindered the efforts.With tens of thousands of people potentially needing help in coming months, the ICRC is appealing for another 9.2 million Swiss francs ($10.10 million) to fund humanitarian efforts.The conflict is also worsening the spread of COVID-19, World Health Organisation spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told a United Nations briefing in Geneva. New cases doubled over the past two weeks in Armenia and rose by 80% in Azerbaijan, he said.;A
MT;More Civilians Killed As Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict Deepens;Azerbaijan and Armenia accused each other of killing civilians by shelling cities in and around Nagorno-Karabakh on Wednesday, in an escalation of a month-long conflict over the mountain enclave that has defied three ceasefires.Azerbaijan said 21 people were killed when Armenian shells hit the town of Barda, northeast of Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenian-backed officials in Nagorno-Karabakh said Azeri shells had fallen on the enclave’s two largest cities, killing one person.Both sides denied each other’s claims.The worst fighting in the South Caucasus for nearly 30 years has raised fears of a wider war that could suck in Russia and Turkey, an ally of Azerbaijan. It also poses a threat to pipelines carrying oil and gas from Azerbaijan to world markets.The International Committee of the Red Cross said it had witnessed shelling in urban areas on both sides of the front line. It said a volunteer from the Azerbaijan Red Crescent Society had been killed and two others injured in the shelling.“These latest exchanges signal that the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict risks spiralling out of control,” Martin Schuepp, the ICRC’s Eurasia regional director, said in a statement. “Civilian lives are being lost at an alarming rate.”Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but is populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians. About 30,000 people were killed in a 1991-94 war in the region.The prosecutor general of Azerbaijan’s office said 21 people had been killed and 70 wounded in Barda.The Emergency and Rescue Service of ethnic Armenian-controlled Nagorno-Karabakh said shells had fallen on Stepanakert, the enclave’s largest city. It said a civilian had been killed and two wounded by shelling in another city, Shushi, 15 km (nine miles) to the south.Armenia’s defence ministry also said a maternity hospital in Stepanakert had been hit. There were no reports of casualties.Armenia’s defence ministry also confirmed on Wednesday that Azerbaijan had seized the strategic town of Gubadli between the enclave and the Iranian border, an apparent military gain that could make a diplomatic solution more difficult.Azerbaijan rejects any solution that would leave Armenians in control of the enclave, which it considers to be illegally occupied. Armenia regards the territory as part of its historic homeland and says the population there needs its protection.The Nagorno-Karabakh defence ministry has recorded 1,068 military deaths since fighting erupted on Sept. 27. Azerbaijan has not disclosed its military casualties. Russia has estimated as many as 5,000 deaths in total.The latest of three ceasefires was brokered in Washington on Sunday. U.S. President Donald Trump called the renewed fighting “disappointing” and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged both sides to pursue a diplomatic solution.The OSCE Minsk Group, formed to mediate the conflict and led by France, Russia and the United States, was due to meet the Azeri and Armenian foreign ministers in Geneva on Thursday but this has not been confirmed.

The Armenians are now given ten days longer (until 25 November) to surrender the area to Azerbaijan.Armenia argued that it needed more time, because there is only one way through which the withdrawal can take place. Troops are now allowed to stay in Kalbajar longer and Armenian residents of the area will also be given more time to pack their belongings. Residents set fire to homes before fleeing to Armenia.According to the peace agreement, Azerbaijan is allowed to keep the conquered territories. The Armenian opposition sees the deal as treason and even plotted a coup, the national security service NSS reported on Saturday. Part of that plan was the killing of Prime Minister Nikol Pasjinian.Last week, the Armenian authorities rounded up 10 prominent opposition figures suspected of organising ""illegal and violent unrest"" on a large scale.Other regions in Nagorno-Karabakh that conquered Azerbaijan have subsequent withdrawal deadlines.

RO;Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Armenia's perspective: Turkey brings Islamists from Syria and wants to provoke a reaction from Russia;"Nagorno-Karabakh is the most significant conflict in the Caucasus and the most dangerous unresolved situation that arose after the collapse of the Soviet Union. There is war again in the region, and greater powers are indirectly involved in the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Leaders from all over the world are calling for an end to hostilities, and the most vocal are Trump, Putin and Macron, the representatives of the countries responsible for coordinating peace talks between the parties.In an interview with Digi24, Serghey Minasyan, Armenia's ambassador to Bucharest, explains this conflict from his country's perspective.Nagorno-Karabakh, the creation of StalinNagorno-Karabakh is Stalin's creation, from his time as commissioner for nationalities in the Soviet Union. When Azerbaijan was taken over by the Bolsheviks in 1920, they needed public support, so they promised The Karabah of Armenia. Because they had to reassure Turkey, the main friend and partner of the Azerbaijanis, they agreed that Azerbaijan would still be in control of the region. Before the collapse of the USSR, Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh sent a petition to Moscow calling for union with Armenia. The situation escalated after the former Soviet states became independent and turned into a full-blown war, with tens of thousands of victims and hundreds of thousands of refugees. It all lasted until 1994, when the parties concluded a truce. It's just that a frozen problem isn't a solved one, so there's fighting going on again in the region.Reasons for the resumption of the nagorno-Karabakh warCristina Cileacu: There is an ongoing war between Armenia and Azerbaijan, in the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave, which is officially owned by Azerbaijan but is run by ethnic Armenians. Why did this conflict, frozen in 1994, resume now?Sergey Minasyan, Ambassador of Armenia to Romania: First, if we are talking about the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh is a state entity that was established during the soviet Union period and after the fall of the USSR, a political entity appeared on this former Azerbaijani territory, that is, the current Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. You remember in the '90s there was a full-scale war. Since 1994 a trilateral relationship has been established between Nagorno-Karabakh, Azerbaijan and the Republic of Armenia, with the help of international mediators. Unfortunately, after this mid-1990s period, Azerbaijan's leadership was unable to succeed in direct negotiations with the people of Nagorno-Karabakh. The negotiating format was under the auspices of the OSCE, chaired by France, Russia and the US, but unfortunately the attempts were not successful, not because of the position of the international community, but because of the uncompromising position of the Azerbaijani leadership. It seems that The gas and oil revenues that Azerbaijan has had since the mid-2000s changed the calculations of the Azerbaijani leadership related to the nagorno-Karabakh conflict. They thought that if they bought a lot of sophisticated weapons from several countries, primarily from Israel...Cristina Cileacu: First of all, from Russia!Sergey Minasyan: Russia, you know, the amount of weapons bought by The Azeri from Russia is quite large. But why did I say Israel in the first place, because unfortunately, Israel has transferred the most sophisticated part of the armaments that the Azerbaijani side, with the help of Turkey, is now using on the front.Cristina Cileacu: Talk about drones.Sergey Minasyan: Drones and other types of missiles and weapons systems. Of course, the main idea of the Azerbaijani side was to try to change this military-political balance, through military power and technological superiority on the front lines.Armenia brings serious charges to TurkeyCristina Cileacu: So, sorry to interrupt, but what you're saying is that because they bought new weapons, they started the war again?Sergey Minasyan: It was a framework or a basis of the current situation. But now it's obvious what the trigger is and it's not something that comes down to the southern caucasus region. There are many statements, from the President of France, from the leadership of Russia, Iran, international observers, too, and they all say that the recent escalation came with the direct support of Turkey, and now we see that this is the first time that Turkey has actually been involved in the military and political process in the southern Caucasus.But the most important and disturbing indicator of this is that they support the transport of Islamist terrorist groups, especially from northern Syria, to Azerbaijan. We already have a lot of evidence about this, and the international community is also informed. And somehow it is also understandable, because it is part of what is called the ""long-term game"" that Turkey's leadership is playing, which is trying to use hybrid Turkish-style elements of war, that is, these terrorist militias, as it has done in many places in the Middle East, including Syria, Libya, and now we see that, with the support of Turkey, In Azerbaijan, Islamists have begun to emerge.What's Russia doing?Turkish President Recep Erdogan's statements about the resumed conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh have raised many questions among the international community, especially because of the moves Turkey has made in recent years in northern Syria, Libya and the Mediterranean through its recent dispute with Greece. The leader in Ankara is now seen as the author of the resumption of this war. On the other hand, the main voice calling for calm and the resumption of negotiations is Russia's, through President Putin.Cristina Cileacu: We are back to this subject, but let us talk a little bit about the interventions of the leaders of Turkey and Russia. Erdogan's position was clear, he argues Azerbaijan, because of course the Azeri are a Muslim population. Russia, on the other hand, intervened to calm the situation. How much does it matter to the parties to the conflict, I mean of course Armenia and Azerbaijan, the two interventions?Sergey Minasyan: Sometimes from the outside it is seen as a kind of war through intermediaries, between Turkey and Russia. But in reality it's not. Of course, in the case of Turkey we see direct involvement. On the other hand, in the case of Russia we have a different situation, because they are not just a regional and global power for this conflict, they are also one of the three presidents of the OSCE negotiating group in Minsk, together with the US and France. So we can't talk about any direct Russian involvement with Armenia. Political and military cooperation are formed, including the transfer of weapons and military equipment. But Russia's official position is that it is trying to maintain a kind of neutrality towards Armenia and Azerbaijan. But of course, if a broader framework for this conflict is to be reached, for example, if Turkey decides to be directly involved against the Republic of Armenia, I believe that not only Russia, but also other members of the international community, including other regional powers, will make their point.Until the conflict is over, the international community considers Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan. Leaders of the OSCE group in Minsk, the US, Russia and France, who support negotiations for a peaceful solution for the region, reacted quickly and called for a ceasefire.Cristina Cileacu: Is Turkey really present in Azerbaijan? Wouldn't that be a very big step that Russia would not tolerate?Sergey Minasyan: Since the last military exercises in Azerbaijan, some of the military aircraft, as well as some of the Turkish military, have remained in Azerbaijan. So we can talk about direct involvement of Turkish instructors and officers on the Azerbaijani side on the Nagorno-Karabakh front. However, it is understandable if there were a reaction from the north, moreover, the emergence and activation of Turkey in the Caucasus, in Nagorno-Karabakh, is actually aimed at provoking a reaction from Moscow, perhaps to discuss other geopolitical issues elsewhere, in the Middle East or the Mediterranean. Syrian mercenaries also fight in Nagorno-KarabakhAre or are there not involved in the war in Nagono-Karabah mercenary fighters brought from Syria? I am, but who brought them? Depends on who you ask, because each of the two fighting sides, Armenia and Azerbaijan, has a different perspective.Cristina Cileacu: During a war, both parties involved usually use propaganda. It's also a weapon that's used in a war. Let's go back a little bit to the presence of Middle Eastern fighters, militias in the region. You said that Turkey has brought militia fighters from Syria, on the other hand the Aizean say that Russia has brought Syrian-Armenians, it is a large armenian community living in Syria, to fight on the front there. So what's it really like?Sergey Minasyan: Evidence of the presence of Islamist militias on the Azerbaijani side was accepted not only on the Armenian side. When the information comes from the President of France, for example, or you see the same kind of statements in the official statements of the Russian Foreign Minister or officials in Iran or even military sources in the US, and this topic is discussed by the leadership of Armenia with leaders from Germany, Russia or others, it follows that it is a situation that makes sense and that we see on the ground. About what the Azeri said about the armenian-Syrianpresence, maybe they're Armenians from Lebanon, from Russia, as the Azerbaijanis outside their country would like to return to Azerbaijan, but I didn't see that happening. But things are not about using Islamist groups that are on the UN's list of terrorist organizations. Here the situation is completely different. There's no evidence from the Azenes of any group of middle Eastern volunteers with the Armenians.What does Armenia want from this war?Cristina Cileacu: War is very complicated for the public. In the case of the Azeans, they were clear that they wanted the Armenians to leave Nagorno-Karabakh. What does Armenia want from this war?Sergey Minasyan: Armenia, the Republic of Armenia and the people of Nagorno-Karabakh, as an unrecognized entity living in the conflict zone, want peace. They want direct negotiations with the Azerbaijani side to try to resolve this situation, because we have talked so far about the political, military, diplomatic and geopolitical dimension of this conflict, but the most tragic thing we see is that every day soldiers and civilians die. On the fifth or sixth day of this conflict, the Azerbaijani side began bombing the capital Nagorno-Karabakh, Stepanakert. A lot of civilians died. Of course, this has led to a reaction from the authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh and we are witnessing a new round of intensification of the fighting. So we should think about civilians, we should think about how to move forward and end the fighting through direct negotiations between the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic and Azerbaijan. On the front we see these battles, but we should consider how, with the help of the international community, it would be possible for the parties involved to reach a stable truce and try to resolve this confict, so that it does not end up being a burden for future generations.Cristina Cileacu: It is a solution proposed by Ilham Aliyev, president of Azerbaijan, who said that to start negotiations it is only necessary for Armenia to withdraw its troops from Nagorno-Karabakh. How about that?Sergey Minasyan: First, there are no Armenian troops in the region. Second, as I said at the beginning of our discussion, the real problem of the Azerbaijani leadership is that it wants everything without demonstrating that it is ready to compromise. If you say that Armenia should withdraw its troops from Nagorno-Karabakh, it also means that the entire Armenian population should leave Nagorno-Karabakh. This is not a proposal, it is just an ultimatum that cannot be taken into account either by Armenia or by the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic.Iran, a worried and neutral neighborIran is very careful about what is happening in Nagorno-Karabakh, because basically the war is on its border, but officially it is not on the side of any combatant. President Hassan Rouhani has also joined voices calling for a ceasefire. At the same time, in Iran, the population of Azerbaijani origins is protesting and asking for support for Azerbaijan.Cristina Cileacu: You mentioned earlier Iran, neighbor to both countries involved in the conflict, but in Iran there are also protests that support the Azerbaijani side. How do you see this position of Iran, which is also a major player in the region, not just Turkey.Sergey Minasyan: Iran is a major player not only in our region, but in a wider region, and it is a known thing. Yes, Iran is a multinational country and because of this Iran's position is quite clear and they have already had a statement in response to bringing terrorist groups directly to Iran's northern border. I understand that the leaders of Iran are trying to be ready for any kind of surprise from the north, I mean the Azerbaijani side. They also had a statement condemning the party that wants to involve these Islamist groups in the region, and I think it's clear to whom the message was addressed.An island of democracy surrounded by autocratsCristina Cileacu: Your country went through a revolution two years ago and is now trying to develop as a democracy. But if we look around it it is surrounded by fewer democracies and more autocrats. Including this conflict are involved three autocrats: Ilham Aliyev, Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Do you see this as an attack on Armenia's democracy?Sergey Minasyan: The day before the start of the war, the Prime Minister of Armenia gave an interview in which he spoke about his previous talks with Ilham Aliyev, held immediately after the Revolution (n.r. from Armenia) and said that during these talks Ilham Aliyev asked him not to play the book of the revolution in negotiations, because there were rumors in both countries that this revolutionary wave could have reached Azerbaijan. That's why, from this perspective, I think it's obvious that when we talk about the neighbouring country ruled by a dynasty of almost 60 years, because, you know, the current Azerbaijani president is the son of the former KGB general.Cristina Cilacu: Heidar Aliyev, yes.Sergey Minasyan: The former leader of the Political Bureau, who was the leader of Soviet Azerbaijan in the mid-1960s, so we're talking about something totally different. I should also say about Armenia's success at the front, including the Nagorno-Karabakh army in maintaining its position on the front line, because after 10 days of conflict, the Azerbaijani side has failed to do much. And this was made possible by the revolutionary enthusiasm that came after the Velvet Revolution in April-May 2018.";N
RO;Armenia and Azerbaijan accuse each other of violating the newly concluded peace agreement;"The Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire agreement appears to be a hard promise to keep. Within half an hour of its entry into force, the forces of Armenia and Azerbaijan resumed bombing. As usual, the two sides accuse each other of a breach of the deal, which comes after two weeks of fighting, according to CNN.At a news conference in Baku, Hikmet Hajiev, an adviser to Azerbaijani President Ilham Alimev, accused Armenia of ""violating"" the agreed conditions.""Azerbaijan has no claims to the territory of any other state. If Armenia continues its challenges, Azerbaijan mustrespond,"" hesaid.Armenia denied violating the agreement, saying it was an ""invention"". Instead, he claimed that Azerbaijani forces had attacked the city of Hadrut.""The statement of Azerbaijan's Ministry of Defence is another invention, said aspokesman for the Armenian Ministry of Defence.The agreement was reached last night in Moscowat the end of ten hours of talks. Mediated by Russia, France and the United States, it provides, among other things, for prisoner exchanges between the two parties.The weapons will be temporarily silent to allow the exchange of prisoners of war, the movement of other persons and the recovery of the bodies of those killed, according to the criteria of the International Committee of the Red Cross, but the ""specific parameters"" of the implementation of the ceasefire agreement were to be agreed after the conclusion of the discussions sponsored by Sergei Lavrov.Armenia and Azerbaijan have also reached an agreement to start ""substantial negotiations"" for a peaceful resolution of the conflict, with the mediation of the co-chairs of the Minsk Group of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).The Nagorno-Karabakh region is an administrative part of Azerbaijan, but is inhabited mostly by Armenians. The two countries have faced each other several times in recent decades without reaching a compromise.The official death toll on Friday indicated more than 400 dead, including 22 Armenian civilians and 31 Azerbaijanis. But there is unreliable data, and in reality it could be much higher, with each side claiming to have eliminated thousands of enemy soldiers.";N

So far, both Armenians and Azenes have suffered significant casualties in human and combat techniques in recent days.According to The Drive and Jerusalem Post, the rocket, pulled by The Azeri on the access road between Armenia and Nagorno Karabah, is Israeli-made.More specifically, it would be a precision missile LORA (LOng Range Attack), with a range of 400 kilometers, capable of carrying a load of 570 kilograms of explosive, with sub-monms, or of the ""bunker buster"" type.

RO;Nagorno-Karabakh: Armenia and Azerbaijan accuse each other of violating temporary ceasefire agreement;"Armenia and Azerbaijan accuse each other of violating a temporary ceasefire agreement in the Nagorno-Karabakh region on Saturday after marathon truce talks took place in Moscow on Friday.The ceasefire agreement, reached after ten-hour negotiations in Moscow, which was also attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, aimed to stop hostilities so that Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan can exchange prisoners and recover the bodies of those killed.   The Moscow talks were the first diplimatic contact between the two sides since the recent violence began on September 27, which killed more than 300 people.   The enclave is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but is populated and administered by Armenians.   Shortly after the agreement came into force - at noon on Saturday - both sides were accused of violating it, Reuters reports.   The Armenian Defense Ministry accused Azerbaijan of bombing a settlement in Armenia, and Armenian forces in Karabakh claimed that Azerbaijani forces had launched a new offensive immediately.   Azerbaijan said the enemy forces in Karabakh bombed The Azerbaijani territory.   Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev told RBC that the parties to the war are now engaged in an attempt to reach a political settlement, but suggested that the fighting would continue.   ""We will go all the way and take what is, by right, ours,"" he said.   Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov said the deal would only take as long as it would take the Red Cross to arrange the exchange of the deceased.   At a briefing in Baku, he said Azerbaijan hopes and expects to take over larger territory in time.   The Armenian Foreign Ministry said it uses all diplomatic channels to try to support the ceasefire, while the Foreign Ministry of Nagorno-Karabakh accused Azerbaijan of using talks on a deal to cover up its military action.   Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who brokered marathon negotiations, said in a statement on Saturday that a temporary ceasefire was decided on humanitarian grounds.   Lavrov said the two countries would now start ""substantial"" talks. They will be kept under the auspices of the OSCE (Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe).   Azerbaijan said it wanted a change in the format of the talks, wanting to involve Turkey, and on Saturday accused France of not being a neutral mediator.   Putin spoke by phone with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Saturday about the agreement, the Kremlin announced. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif later tweeted that the agreement was a step toward peace.   Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center and former colonel in the Russian army, also tweeted. He believes that any discussion of peace could fail and that Azerbaijan will continue to push for Armenian forces to leave the enclave, which is unacceptable to Armenia.   ""For Russia, the most important issues in the South Caucasus are securing borders against jihadists coming from the Middle East and elsewhere and Turkey's growing role in the region. This means that Moscow cannot turn its back on the nagorno-Karabakh conflict and allow the war to proceed,"" he wrote.   The resumption of fighting in the three-decade-old conflict has raised fears of a wider war involving Turkey, an Azerbaijani ally, and Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia.   Violent confrontations have also led to growing fears about the security of pipelines carrying oil and gas from Azerbaijan to Europe.   The fighting now is the worst since the 1991-1994 war, in which 30,000 people died and ended with a ceasefire agreement that was repeatedly violated.   Turkey welcomed the recent ceasefire agreement, but said much more was needed. The Azerbaijani and Turkish Foreign Ministers also spoke by phone on Saturday.";N
RO;Nagorno-Karabakh: Armenia and Azerbaijan agree on temporary ceasefire;"Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed on a temporary ceasefire in the conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, the Russian Foreign Minister announced after midnight, following ten hours of talks in Moscow, the BBC reports.Sergei Lavrov said the two countries would now start ""substantial"" talks.   More than 300 people have died and thousands of people have been displaced since the conflicting violence began on September 27.   Hostilities were halted at noon on Saturday to allow a prisoner exchange and the recovery of the bodies of the deceased.   Nagorno-Karabakh is ruled by ethnic Armenians, although it is officially part of Azerbaijan.   The two former Soviet republics blamed each other for the outbreak of recent violence, the worst in about three decades.   Russia has a military base in Armenia and both are part of the CSTO (Collective Security Treaty Organization) alliance. Moscow, on the other hand, has good relations with Azerbaijan.   On Friday, the Armenian Defense Minister said the fighting had continued, despite talks in Moscow. On Thursday, Armenia accused Azerbaijan of deliberately bombing a historic cathedral in Nagorno-Karabakh. At the same time, Azerbaijan said the country's second largest city, Ganja, and the Goranboy region were bombed by Armenian forces, an attack in which at least one civilian died.   Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pasinian warned this week of ""genocide"" in the region that he said was ""Armenia, armenian land.""   The clashes led to the displacement of half of Nagorno-Karabakh's population, about 70,000, officials said.   The region's main city, Stepanakert, was hit by numerous bombings, with people sheltering in basements, and the city running out of electricity.   Armenia and Azerbaijan began the war for the Nagorno-Karabakh region in 1988-1989. They agreed to a cease-fire, but they never reached a deal.";N

RS;All actions Azerbaijan is taking are within its own, internationally recognised borders – Karabakh is Azerbaijan;"In the background of the general debates of the 75th President of the United State, At a time when the world is battling the Covid-19 pandemic, Armenia's aggressive military political leadership has resorted to another military adventure and provocation.September 27th, 2020. Armenian armed forces, grossly violating the cease-fire regime, began firing large-caliber weapons, mortars and artillery of different calibres on positions and densely populated villages of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Among the civilian population and military faces of Azerbaijan, there are dead and wounded. It also caused serious damage to homes and civilian facilities, killed 13 Azerbaijani djivils, including 2 children and 2 elderly people, and hospitalised more than 40 civilians.In order to prevent the next military aggression of Armenia and to provide security for densely populated areas of the civilian population along the separation line, the Armed Forces of the Republic of Azerbaijan are taking counteroffensive and proportionate measures within the right to self-defence and in full compliance with international humanitarian law.Another Armenian aggression against Azerbaijan constitutes a gross violation of fundamental norms and principles of international law, UN Security Council Resolution no. 822, 853, 874 and 884 in 1993.

[Getty)Turkey's role has a steady character in the region, and from the first moment the world community learned that Armenia had invaded Azerbaijan, Turkey unequivocally declared its support for Azerbaijan in support of international law. That is precisely what Turkey's role is all about, in nothing else. Turkey is providing us with moral support and we are grateful to the Turkish leadership, the President and the Turkish people for their solidarity and support. Turkey does not participate in this conflict in any other capacity. And all the rumours that Turkey is participating as a side in the conflict, spreading from the Armenian side, have a provocative character – it's fake news.Armenia's military authorities are still expected to respond to the two downed SU-25s. Armenia, for propaganda purposes and in an attempt to hide its shame, tried to blame the stealth F16 plane.Turkish Military Air Force F-16s do not in any way participate in the war. Today, considering modern technologies, it is very difficult to hide something, since there are objective ways of tracking, there are satellite observations, and therefore it is very easy to verify that this is another provocation. We understand the goal of the Armenian side – to create such fake news, for one thing, in order to disparage the combat capability of the Azerbaijani army, which now honourably fulfils the task of restoring territorial integrity, and also to create an impression that the conflict is flammable, to involve third countries, and thus to try to attract as many countries as possible to justify your provocation. Turkey is not a party to the conflict, it is not participating in it in any way and there is no need for it.In recent days, we have witnessed a campaign of smear and slander in some foreign media about allegedly ""militants from Syria being deployed to Azerbaijan"". There is no doubt that Armenia is behind these allegations, which are not based on any facts and spread in the form of interviews with fictional people. This defamatory campaign is intended to compensate for negative international public opinion, created on the basis of the demonstrative relocation of representatives of terrorist organisations from the Middle East to the occupied territoriesAzerbaijan by Armenia, a gross violation of international humanitarian law.There are numerous facts about armenia's use of terrorist groups and mercenaries in military operations during the occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding regions of Azerbaijan. Currently, the Armenian leadership continues this policy and widely uses extremist elements against Azerbaijan as part of its new act of aggression. So, the planArmenia to create ""voluntary militant groups"" to be used for military purposes is aimed at using the ""services"" of terrorists who have been moved to Armenia from the Middle East for years.Unlike Armenia, which has been experiencing a serious demographic crisis for years in which it has been unable to equip its armed forces, Azerbaijan, as has already been stated, has a full-scale armed force, and these armed forces are so professional and strong that no external forces, especially irregular groups, are needed to achieve the set goal.These false claims are incompatible from a military-technical standpoint because they lack simple logic. Various sources claim several hundred mercenaries were allegedly brought to Azerbaijan. That's when such a question is asked: In the context of a possible conflict between the two regular armies, can a small number of irregular groups change the power ratio? Of course, those who spread misinformation are unable to answer this question.Armenian media reported that two journalists from the French newspaper Le Monde were injured in the occupied Nagorno-Karabakh region of the Republic of Azerbaijan.We would like to note that Armenia is organising visits by journalists in the area of military operations, endangering the lives of foreign journalists and grossly violating international humanitarian law.We are reminded that the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Azerbaijan issued an official statement on 27 February. September 2020. In 2013, the Azerbaijan Army did not target civilians and civilian infrastructure and that, unlike the occupied Armenia, it meets the requirements of international humanitarian law provisions , including the Geneva Conventions during military operations.The deliberate detention of foreign journalists in the danger zone clearly demonstrates that the Armenian government is ignoring its obligations to ensure the safety of journalists and to use foreign journalists for their propaganda purposes.We appeal to foreign journalists to obtain the consent of the Azerbaijani side regarding visits to the occupied Nagorno-Karabakh and the neighbouring regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan.Azerbaijan has repeatedly warned the international community that Armenia is preparing for a new act of aggression and war, and that the presence of Armenian armed forces in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan is a major threat to regional peace and stability.";A
RS;Azerbaijan: Armenia suffers heavy losses, armed forces forced to withdraw;A spokesman for Azerbaijan's Defence Ministry, Lieutenant Colonel Anar Avazov, claims that the Armenian armed forces suffered heavy losses on the fifth day of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.- The Armenian armed forces are forced to retreat in various directions, Avazov said at today's briefing.Azerbaijan's Defence Ministry said that during a counteroffensive by the Azerbaijani armed forces on 27 March 2007, the Azerbaijani armed forces were killed in a counter-offensive. September incapacitated up to 200 tanks, more than 228 artillery weapons, 300 air defence systems, six command-and-control checkpoints, five ammunition depots and one S-300 Armenian armed forces anti-aircraft missile complex.Earlier, Armenian Vice Prime Minister Tigran Avigan claimed that 1,280 Azerbaijani soldiers were killed and 2,700 wounded during five days of fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh.Today, Avigan published an infographic on his Facebook page, saying that in addition to those figures, Azerbaijan has lost 90 drones, 12 helicopters, 181 tanks and an infantry combat vehicle, three heavy fire systems, two Smerch systems and four aircraft since the escalation.;A
RS;Tank, artillery and drone battles: Azerbaijan has a stronger and more numerous army, but Armenia has an ACE up its sleeve;"A war between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces has flared up in Nagorno-Karabakh. Tensions between the two countries have not stopped over the years, despite attempts by foreign diplomats to reach a peaceful solution. For now, the fighting is mainly led by artillery, tanks, drones and helicopters.What do the armenian and Azerbaijan armies have?The armies of Azerbaijan and Armenia are dominated by Soviet and Russian armaments, respectively. When it comes to their conflict, two other major interested powers, Turkey and Russia, must be mentioned.Russia sells arms to both countries and has intensive military co-operation with Armenia. There is also a Russian military base on Armenia soil. Armenia is also a member of the ODKB (Collective Security Treaty Organization), which gives it greater opportunities to co-operate with Russia and purchase weapons.Turkey openly supports Azerbaijan. Armenia claims they are being attacked by Turkish F-16 jets and that one shot down an Armenian Su-25, something Azerbaijan and Turkey deny.Much of the weapons and techniques of Azerbaijan and Armenia have already been lost in the Nagorno-Karabakh war, and reconstruction and investment in the army has since begun.The outcomes of military conflicts are not always easy to predict, and they depend on many factors. Analysts generally agree that Azerbaijan has a stronger and more numerous army, but that Armenia has some strategic advantages because of the configuration of the terrain and the areas it controls.Azerbaijan shows off its muscles on land, in the air and at seaAccording to the Global Firepower Index website, which ranks the world's armies, Azerbaijan ranks 64th in the world. of the 138 places on the list, RTS quoted him as saying.The country has about 67,000 active troops and about 300,000 more in reserve (the total population is about 10 million people).Azerbaijan's defence budget stands at $2 billion and $805m. The country, like Armenia, has multiplyed its military budget over the past decade. According to CIA data, Azerbaijan's defence budget for 2019 is 1.5% of the world's total. In 2014, it stood at 4% of GDP, which is very high, placing it 10th in the world by that parameter.When it comes to mechanization, it is stated that Azerbaijan has about 500 tanks, and more than 1,400 armored vehicles. The army compiles T-55, T-72 and T-90S tanks. The BTR-60 and BTR-70 dominate among the armored personnel transporters.There are 187 pieces of self-hide artillery, and 227 pieces of tow artillery, as well as mortars. The most precarious is the self-arresting howitzer 2S3, better known as ""gvozdika"".Azerbaijan's air force counts a total of 147 aircraft. The base consists of ""mig 29"" planes purchased from Ukraine. Last year, a craft of this type crashed into the Caspian Sea. After that, and because of the Armenian procurement of new aircraft, seriously, the procurement and modernisation of Azerbaijan's multi-purpose aircraft began to be seriously considered.Besides, there's the Su-24 and the Su-25, as well as the ""mig 21"". Azerbaijan also owns a transport il-76.Azerbaijan has 88 helicopters. Of those, 15 are offensive Mi-24s. When it comes to transport helicopters, there are Mi-8s and an easily armed Mi-2 transport helicopter.Unlike Armenia, which has no way out to sea, azerbaijan's armed forces also have a navy of 31 vessels. Four submarines and one frigate should be mentioned.Armenia issues nearly 5 % of GDP for defenceThe Global Firepower Index lists the Armenian army as ranked 111st in the world. Place. It includes 45,000 active soldiers and 200,000 reservists (a total population of about three million people).The defence budget is $1.385m. According to the CIA, Armenia allocates 4.9% of GDP for defence, and is seventh in the world by that parameter. The percentage of Azerbaijan and Armenia's allocation for military and defence says a lot about the awareness and readiness of these countries for warfare.Armenia has 110 tanks, the most subdued of which are T-72s. The army includes 748 armoured combat vehicles, dominated by BMP-1.There are also self-arresting howitzers 2S1, but there's more traction artillery.According to data from most websites, the Air Force consists of 64 aircraft, nine of which are fighter jets, three transport and 13 school aircraft.However, Armenia recently acquired Su-30SM aircraft from Russia, and additional deliveries are planned. It's a four-plus-generation aircraft, exceptional features and manoeuverability.Armenia has 37 helicopters, 20 of which are offensive. Starring Mi-24.Nagorno-Karabakh's forces, consisting of 20,000 well-trained soldiers and officers, must also be mentioned, which is a constant state of alert. Their training and exercises are very common and intense.They are equipped with tanks, artillery and PVO systems, as well as a small number of planes and helicopters.What have we seen so far?Assessing the state of armies ""on paper"" and doing rankings is always ungrateful because it does not show data on the state of technique, weapons and training and morale of soldiers, rtS writes.We don't know what scale the latest escalation of the conflict will be due to Nagorno-Karabakh, but so far the fighting is mainly led by tanks, artillery and drones. The data on human and material losses is different, but based on published footage and photographs, we can conclude what has been used so far from weapons and equipment.Azerbaijan's Defence Ministry has shown footage of alleged drone strikes against Armenian troops. According to them, they destroyed at least six PVO systems of the 9K33 ""wasp"" and three 9k35 ""arrow 10"".Although the Azerbaijani military has not said what type of drone it used, an analysis by The Drive magazine suggests it was most likely a Turkish-made TB2S ""bayraktar"" drone, which was obtained in June this year.The drone can launch less precisely guided missiles and has already shown itself fighting in Syria and Libya, especially against smaller-range PVO systems.Azerbaijan has also acquired an Israeli ""harop"" drone, but it is not known if it was used in the latest attacks.Azerbaijani drones are seen to have destroyed or damaged several T-72 tanks, BMP-1 and BMP-2 armored vehicles, trucks and artillery belonging to the Armenian army and Nagorno-Karabakh forces.On the other hand, we have footage showing Armenian forces destroying Azerbaijani T-72 tanks, as well as BMP-1 and BMP-2 armadillos. At least one BTR-82 anti-armor guided missile transporter was also destroyed.These missiles are particularly suitable for fighting on the Nagorno-Karabakh mountainous terrain, which poses a problem for the movement of heavy artillery.There are also unconfirmed reports of the downing of an Armenian Mi-8 helicopter and a drone.Both countries have more advanced weapons that have not yet been used. Azerbaijan, for example, claims to destroy S-300 systems approaching the conflict zone.Certainly, an even more intense conflict between the two countries would hardly have passed without direct or indirect interference from foreign powers, especially since the Caucas is in a strategically important position where many see their interests.";N
RS;The treaty has been reached, the Russian peacekeepers have arrived, but this is why the whole world is still anxious;"Russia's peacekeeping mission in Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian region at disputed with Azerbaijan, has released a map detailing future operations and clarifying many territorial ambiguities in the ceasefire announced by Yewan and Baku on 10 March. November.According to the map, the situation in the region will mostly return to the conditions that existed before the first modern war between the two countries in 1991. – Azerbaijan will deploy artillery on the hills near the town of Shushi, a few kilometers from the capital Nagorno-Karabakh Stepanakert, and the region itself will essentially be cut off from Armenia, according to Meduza.io.Many political issues have also been raised, as well as the issue of the security of ethnic Armenians in the region, as Russian peacekeepers will only be present for five years. There is a possibility of extending the mission unless either side withdraws from the disputed territories within the next four and a half years. Also, for the first time in history, Baku received a dirt corridor to his western encla in the Autonomous Republic of Nahchivan.NEW TRILATERAL AGREEMENTUnder the agreement, Armenia will hand over not only the southern territories of Nagorno-Karabakh (which Azerbaijan reclaimed during the six-week war), but also two districts in the north that it has not lost in the conflict. These northern areas in the Soviet Union were not part of the region, but were taken by Armenians in 1993. Until then, ethnic Azerbaijani lived there, and the last 25 years have been sparsely populated.Armenian Karabakh still exists, but the borders have shrunk radically and there is no mention of political status anywhere.When Russia announced it would deploy peacekeepers to patrol the region's border, it was not clear what boundaries were being announced, however according to a map released by the Russian mission, the trilateral agreement is being used on old Soviet demarcation lines, meaning the Armenian withdrawal is not as drastic as it could have been, according to Meduza.io.Still, Armenian Karabakh managed to salvage less than a third of the territory it controlled before September, and the area is now guarded by about 2,000 Russian peacekeepers.After the agreement was announced, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev revealed that Baku plans to invite Turkish peacekeepers to participate in the ceasefire, although the Kremlin has shown a far more limited role for Ankara, stating that Turkey is sending observers, not peacekeepers, to monitor compliance with the ceasefire from a joint centre on Azerbaijani territory outside Karabakh.Still dominated by ethnic Armenians, the self-proclaimed republic of Nagorno-Karabakh has no official status under the new framework and is losing its border with Armenia, while the entire District of Lacina will open from 1 January 2007. [The New York Times) first reported on The New York Times in 2013.Russian peacekeepers will guard the Lachin corridor to preserve Armenia's connection to Nagorno-Karabakh, and Baku has vowed not to interfere with the traffic of people on the aisle.Azerbaijan will thus effectively gain territory in Armenia, a corridor to its western encla, AR Nahchivan, which shares a small part of the border with Turkey, an ally of Baku, the Russians will guard the corridor through Armenia, but there are some major ambiguities, here's the thing:It is not known how the uncomproprised administration of the self-proclaimed republic of Nagorno-Karabakh will continue to function as it has for the past quarter-century. The agreement says nothing about holding or cancelling the administration's operations, and it will be far harder for Yereman to support local government in Karabakh now that the region is separated from Armenia.And the future of the Karabakh army is in question because Armenia will find it harder to transfer military equipment through territory politically controlled by Baku.Three decades ago, ethnic Azerbaijani people made up the majority of the population in areas around the Karabakh region, including Shushi, which is now returning to Baku's control. The new agreement allows these people to return to the homes they have abandoned, but the fate of ethnic Azerbaijanis who have since seated in those cities is unresolved. Even Armenians within the borders of the unacquised republic of Karabakh could find themselves under pressure to leave.During the six-week war, many people fled Karabakh to Armenia, and the arrival of the Russians is unlikely to encourage them to return. There is an Azerbaijani army in the hills above Stepanakert- the vein that has biased the region with Armenia has been cut off and no one knows if Russian soldiers will be there in five years to protect residents from another attack. Despite the formal assurances under the agreement, many Azerbaijani refugees can also give up because of the uncertainty.The war has endangered sites such as the Dadivank monastery and the ruins of Tigranakert in karabakh districts, which will now return to Baku. Armenia recognises the sites as important remnants of cultural heritage and worries that Azerbaijan will destroy evidence of their long history there, something Baku denies. Meduza.io says satellite photos suggest Azerbaijani destroyed an ancient Armenian cemetery in Nahchivan.In four and a half years, Azerbaijan will be able to request the withdrawal of the Russian mission, allowing it to proceed with its official goal in the region -- ""the final solution to the Karabakh issue"". There are signs that Azerbaijan plans to stick to the agreed-upon mission and extend the mission for more than five years. Aliyev said he personally insisted on the dirt corridor to Nahchivan, which they had not had for three decades. Construction of a new road through the Lachin corridor also indicates a possible extension. The new passage will bypass Shushi, unlike the existing one that goes around the city.It is also possible that the leaders of the trilateral agreement countries - apart from Aliyev and Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan - will change their minds about Karabakh. By the time five years go by, some of them could be without power, Meduza.io.By openly helping Azerbaijan in the conflict, Turkey has strengthened its influence in the Caucasus and the region, showing itself to be an effective, determined ally. Some military experts say Ankara has demonstrated the feasibility of ""unfrooling"" the old conflict with the help of modern weapons and tactics that could have profound consequences throughout the former Soviet Union.The consequences of the six-week war are also a threat to Russian foreign policy in the region, where the Kremlin froze conflicts in exchange for military bases and peace zones. On the other hand, freezing the conflict and deploying peacekeepers is exactly what Moscow has achieved with the new agreement. By deploying the peacekeeping mission, Russia essentially built a military base on Azerbaijani soil.Unless there is a radical change, the Kremlin is likely to use every bit of influence it has over Baku to keep its mission in Karabakh beyond the agreed deadline. Despite close ties between Azerbaijan and Turkey, the need for good relations with Russia was enough to pressure Baku to end the offensive a few kilometres from Stepanakert.Europe and the US could work with Russia to keep the conflict frozen, preventing a humanitarian catastrophe among the remaining Armenians in Karabakh. France has already requested the resumption of international negotiations on the status of the region.In five years, the Meduza.io, it is even possible for Armenia to rebuild its army, which would make the price of a ""final solution"" for Karabakh too expensive for Baku.";A
RU;Russia & Turkey disagree on how to solve the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, with Ankara preferring a military solution, says Kremlin;Moscow and Ankara are working together in Nagorno-Karabakh, but don't fully see eye-to-eye. In an exclusive interview with RT, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov admitted the countries disagree on the use of military force.“Turkey has consistently taken the position to approve a military operation,” Peskov explained. “We seriously disagreed, and still disagree about this with our Turkish colleagues. But this does not prevent us from continuing close interaction at all levels, including at the highest level.”According to the spokesman, the good relationship between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan means that the two nations can put aside their differences and come together to solve problems in the Caucasus.“Both Russia and Turkey are vitally interested in our region being stable, predictable, and peaceful,” Peskov said. “Interaction meets the interests of both Moscow and Ankara.”On September 27, the frozen Nagorno-Karabakh conflict suddenly erupted once again. The dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia is decades old, with both countries believing they have legitimate claims to the territory.Throughout the recent 6-week-long war, both Moscow and Ankara played an active role in trying to bring it to an end. On one side of the conflict, Armenia is allied to Russia, as both are part of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). On the other, Azerbaijan has a close relationship with its neighbor Turkey.On November 10, the leaders of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia signed a statement on the cessation of hostilities between Baku and Yerevan, in Nagorno-Karabakh. According to the agreement, Armenia lost control of territory it previously controlled, and Russian peacekeepers have been deployed along the line of contact. There will be no Turkish ground troops in the region, but Ankara will take a role in monitoring the situation.;N
RU;UN assessment mission in Nagorno-Karabakh; It has been reported that UN senior officials decided to send a comprehensive assessment mission to the area of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. It is understood that representatives of competent humanitarian agencies will take part in the mission in order to review the situation on the ground and assess the needs of those in distress. Preparations for and discussion of the parameters of this assessment mission are currently in progress. For our part, we consider it useful and necessary to intensify humanitarian assistance to all victims through competent international organisations, in coordination with the parties. Russian ministries and agencies began relevant efforts immediately after the adoption of the trilateral statement by the leaders of Russia, Azerbaijan and Armenia on November 9, 2020, the statement that made it possible to cease hostilities. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in Sochi On December 29, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu will pay a working visit to Sochi, Russia, at the invitation of Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to attend the 8th meeting of the Joint Strategic Planning Group that functions within the framework of the High-Level Russian-Turkish Cooperation Council. On March 29, 2019, Antalya was the venue for the Council’s seventh meeting. The participants will review a wide range of topical regional and international matters. They will compare positions on the situation in the Middle East and North Africa, the South Caucasus, Central Asia, Ukraine and the Black Sea region. They will discuss ways of facilitating more effective cooperation at international organisations.There are plans to analyse current matters linked with implementing the November 9, 2020 Joint Statement by the Leaders of Russia, Azerbaijan and Armenia on Nagorno-Karabakh. The participants will prioritise efforts to minimise risks of possible armed clashes and to provide the former belligerents with humanitarian relief.The participants will focus on streamlining the activities of the joint Russian-Turkish centre for monitoring the ceasefire and ending all hostilities in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict zone.;N
RU;Question: Russia has opened the way to peace between Azerbaijan and Armenia. In Russia as well as in Azerbaijan, these words are also heard, and they like to cite the example of two peoples living together in the past in different historical periods, including during the Soviet era. There are good examples of this harmony, when people living in Baku, for example, were not divided by nationality. What is the key to the success of peaceful coexistence and interaction between the two peoples? How can the historical stress experienced by the people be overcome? How do you see the life of Azerbaijani and Armenian people as a result of the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement?;Maria Zakharova: Many things are included in your question. There is positive historical experience of the two nations living together – the Azerbaijani and Armenians – both on the territory of Azerbaijan and in Armenia: they worked together, made friends, and created families.Now, thanks to Russia’s mediation efforts, the bloodshed has been stopped, agreements have been reached on the return of refugees and internally displaced persons, and on unblocking transport and economic connections in the region. A humanitarian response centre has been established to assist Azerbaijan and Armenia in restoring civilian infrastructure and creating conditions for the normal life of their people. This creates real conditions for establishing a dialogue between the two peoples, and a dialogue is the only possible way to overcome the differences.With all the dissimilarities in the region, with all the deep differences between neighbours, it is necessary to look for ways to combine the interests of the parties. In our opinion, a greater focus should be placed on the implementation of various mutually beneficial options of synergy of trade, transport and energy capabilities in the region.There is no doubt that the agenda needs to include building up and consolidating contacts between businesspeople, scientists, and civil society representatives in general. One possible approach is mutual visits by journalists. I believe that this is a right step towards sustainable peace between the people of Azerbaijan and Armenia.But all this is only possible given the political will of the leaders of the states in question.;N
RU;Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s remarks and answers to media questions at a joint news conference following talks with Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Armenia Ara Aivazian;On November 21, 2020, a Russian interagency delegation visited Yerevan upon the instructions of President of Russia Vladimir Putin. We held meetings with Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan and our colleagues from the Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defence and economic development agencies to discuss in detail the situation following the signing of the Joint Statement by the leaders of Russia, Armenia and Azerbaijan on November 9 this year, as well as tasks set to us in this connection in the interests of a full settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh problem and in the context of promoting bilateral ties between Russia and Armenia.The Statement signed on November 9 created the necessary conditions for a lasting and fair settlement of the conflict in the interests of the Armenian and Azerbaijani people and stability in the South Caucasus.We are satisfied with the fact that the ceasefire has been complied with on the ground for nearly a month. Refugees are returning to their homes, and there has been progress in the exchange of prisoners and the dead and in the search for missing persons.  We would like these acute humanitarian issues to be settled as soon as possible. We have mapped out a number of steps towards this.We are grateful to our friends for a high assessment of the activities of the Russian peacekeeping force. Another priority apart from the humanitarian issues I mentioned is providing assistance to the restoration of the infrastructure, housing, normal life and the healthcare system.  The unblocking of the transport corridors and the entire range of economic ties, as stipulated in the November 9 Joint Statement, should play a positive role in revitalising the economy and restoring normal life in the region.We discussed the establishment of a Humanitarian Response Centre at the initiative of President Putin. We proposed making it an international agency with the participation of Armenia and Azerbaijan. The practical aspects of this initiative are being coordinated. Many Russian ministries and agencies will contribute to its implementation.We exchanged views on the involvement of the related international organisations in the post-conflict rehabilitation of the region. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has been working there for many years, since the mid-1990s. It has its representatives in Yerevan, Baku and Stepanakert. The ICRC group in the region will be increased, as ICRC President Peter Maurer told us during his recent visit to Moscow. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the World Food Programme (WFP), UNICEF and UNESCO have shown interest in the matter as well.UNESCO is concerned about the preservation of world cultural heritage sites. This is also in the interests of Armenia. Russia supports this approach.Our goal is to ensure that the restoration of the economy, infrastructure, healthcare and life support systems helps to create conditions for the development of neighbourly ties between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, both in Nagorno-Karabakh and at the interstate level. This would help build up the atmosphere of trust and cooperation in the region to the benefit of local people and countries.Question: Could you outline the main objectives and fields of interaction of the OSCE Minsk Group co-chairs in light of the Statement signed by the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia and the President of the Russian Federation on November 9 and the Joint Statement by the Heads of Delegation of the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chair Countries signed on December 3?Sergey Lavrov: The OSCE Minsk Group and its co-chairs Russia, the United States and France (it was initially co-chaired by Russia and the United States: France joined it later at Paris’ request) have accomplished a great deal over the past few years. In particular, they have drafted and coordinated – in general, though not in detail – the basic principles of a settlement with the parties. These principles were used as the basis of the agreement sealed in the November 9 Statement by the leaders of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia.  I am referring to the transfer of five districts to Azerbaijan, to be followed by the transfer of two more districts, as well as the deployment of peacekeepers to ensure security in the region, the establishment of the Lachin Corridor between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia, and the unblocking of all types of transport and economic ties and communications. All these objectives have been formalised in the November 9 Statement and are being implemented very effectively.Question: In your opinion, how effective is the level of cooperation between the Interdepartmental Humanitarian Response Centre and the local authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh in the context of creating favourable conditions for resuming normal life as soon as possible?Sergey Lavrov: Peacekeepers and the Interdepartmental Humanitarian Response Centre are actively cooperating with the local population. Since the very first minutes following their return, the peacekeepers and rescue workers from the Russian Emergencies Ministry have been assisting the people who are returning to the area. This process is now becoming sustainable. People are becoming more confident about the current situation. We will promote this attitude in every way. Current talks on turning the Interdepartmental Humanitarian Response Centre into an international centre that would involve Armenia and Azerbaijan facilitate this process. The concerned agencies are also discussing the relevant documents.The ongoing efforts on the details of the existing agreements include work on the legal aspects of Russian peacekeepers’ zone of responsibility. They are stationed in this zone under the November 9 Statement. The peacekeepers maintain security, create favourable conditions for the return of refugees, help solve humanitarian matters and facilitate normal life.The process is heading in the right direction, as agreed by the parties to the conflict and the co-chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group. We believe that the most important thing is to provide all-round support for the three leaders’ Statement of November 9, 2020. On December 3, 2020, members of the OSCE Ministerial Council held a meeting via videoconference. The three co-chairs, at the level of foreign ministers, praised the November 9 Statement and supported its implementation.Among the tasks that need to be addressed and on which the co-chairs could use their weight and authority I will note the involvement of international organisations. It is very important to chart correct parameters of such cooperation. The International Committee of the Red Cross has been working there for a long time. On the other hand, UN agencies that have a presence in Armenia and Azerbaijan, have never worked in Nagorno-Karabakh. Now, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is preparing a fact-finding mission. This will take some time, but bureaucracy is bureaucracy. The mission is to involve representatives of specialised agencies and programmes of the UN Family who will travel to the region in mid-December. We would like these missions to focus on providing specific and detailed assistance to the people of Nagorno-Karabakh in the most pressing areas, including the restoration of the essential infrastructure and housing, and the resolution of other humanitarian matters.The co-chairs could also focus on the subject of preserving religious sites and cultural landmarks in Nagorno-Karabakh. There are plans to allocate special UNESCO resources for this purpose. This organisation is also preparing its own fact-finding mission.As a co-chair country and acting together with our French and US colleagues, we would like to encourage international organisations to ensure progress in these areas. The preservation and protection of cultural heritage and religious sites has special significance. As a country that is home to the UNESCO Headquarters, France can play a special role in this respect. I believe that the United States can also facilitate this process.Question: The November 9 agreements on Nagorno-Karabakh were obviously a temporary step on the way to a settlement of the Karabakh conflict. Are more substantive discussions on this score planned in the near future, at the level of the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan or at the highest level? When will it be possible to hold such meetings?Sergey Lavrov: I said in my opening remarks that efforts to bring life in that region back to normal, so that all the national, ethnic and religious groups are satisfied, are an important part of a sustainable long-term settlement. This means a neighbourly coexistence of Armenians, Azerbaijanis and other peoples living in the region. This is our agenda and we will welcome any steps that the parties will be ready to take in this direction. We will encourage them to do this. As to the possible timeframe for direct contacts between Baku and Yerevan, including at the highest level, that will be up to our Azerbaijani and Armenian colleagues.;A
RU;‘Everything is destroyed again’: Armenian refugee family shares story with RT in aftermath of new Nagorno-Karabakh war;The war in Nagorno-Karabakh has sent tens of thousands of ethnic Armenians fleeing from the hostilities – and a peace deal, perceived by many as Armenia’s surrender, has left little hope of return, a family of refugees told RT.Some 90,000 civilians have fled Nagorno-Karabakh over the past few weeks as the forces of the breakaway region, supported by Armenia, clashed with Azerbaijani military troops.The self-proclaimed republic broke away from Azerbaijan back in the 1990s. The region, populated predominantly by ethnic Armenians, lived in the legal gray zone – and relative peace – for some 30 years, until the new war broke out late in September.“We’ve built our dreams, we’ve wanted our dreams to come true. But after 30 years, it’s war again. Again, everything is destroyed,” Nanar Eremyan, who fled the region’s capital Stepanakert, told RT.While Eremyan did not initially intend to leave her home behind, she said she had to do so for the sake of her children, as Stepanakert has been repeatedly subjected to shelling and bombardment. Eremyan fled to Armenia’s capital, Yerevan – and she and other refugees have received a very warm welcome from the locals.In addition to refugee shelters and charities, private Armenian citizens sought to help the refugees. Nanar’s family, for instance, has been sheltered by a local woman.“I thought something needs to be done and I’ve started looking for a family to help. They’ve found me, and I’ve found them. They’ve been living with me since October 1,” the woman told RT.The peace deal reached by Armenia and Azerbaijan this week did not bring much relief to the refugees. The agreement has been largely perceived as a surrender by Armenians and triggered mass protests across the country.The deal has returned many Nagorno-Karabakh settlements to Azerbaijan’s control – and that news alone has triggered a new wave of refugees. Nanar believes Baku will never allow them to coexist peacefully, and that many ethnic Armenians will never be able to return home to Nagorno-Karabakh.;E
RU;Armenia agreed armistice with Azerbaijan to save soldiers’ lives, reveals embattled PM Pashinyan;Armenia had to agree a truce with Baku, or its 25,000-man army faced being completely surrounded and routed. That’s according to Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, who is under increasing pressure to explain why he ended the war.In an address to the nation on Thursday, Pashinyan explained that the trilateral ceasefire agreement signed by Yerevan, Baku, and Moscow does not imply a final settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.“When a situation arises when a soldier can no longer influence the situation, then he should not die in the name of his homeland, but the homeland should make sacrifices in the name of the soldier,” Pashinyan explained. “With this understanding, I signed the infamous document, understanding that my risk of dying is high, not only in the political, but also in the physical sense.”In the early hours of Tuesday morning, the prime minister announced that the country had agreed to end hostilities with Azerbaijan, following a bloody conflict which began in late September. After repeatedly claiming that Armenia was winning the war, he is now coming under attack for what many locals see as a surrender. As part of the settlement, Yerevan has lost control of parts of Nagorno-Karabakh, and Russian peacekeepers have been deployed along the contact line.According to Pashinyan, he knew that the peace deal would lead to public discontent, but he believes it was the correct choice to protect his soldiers.“This happened after the General Staff of the Armed Forces reported that the war should be urgently stopped, and the president of Artsakh said Stepanakert [the largest city in Nagorno-Karabakh] could be lost within hours,” Pashinyan explained.On Wednesday, over a thousand Armenian demonstrators, led by opposition leaders, took to Yerevan’s streets to protest the signing of the agreement. Protesters chanted “Nikol is a traitor,” while demanding he resign as leader of the country.;N
RU;America no longer ‘a neighbor to every country on Earth’ — surprise Armenia/Azerbaijan armistice evidence of changing world order;This week’s surprise Nagorno-Karabakh deal heralds a new approach to settling conflicts, where only players directly affected get a say in their settlement. The Western liberal order no longer controls the direction of the world.The cessation of hostilities in Nagorno-Karabakh and the adjustments in the future configuration of the region, offered by the peaceful settlement, matter beyond the regional context. It is another example of employing a new conflict resolution model, when only the countries for whom finding balance is vitally important participate in the peace talks. Other players, which are not directly involved in the situation and are only in it for the influence and prestige, don’t get a say.We all understand why this is important for the South Caucasus. The status quo established after the 1993-1994 war had been maintained here for 26 years. Armenia won that war. The balance of power and international context has drastically shifted since then, but the situation in the conflict zone remained the same.Diplomatic efforts by Russia and other countries had been largely unsuccessful, because the opposing sides had no real interest in resolving the issue. Both countries claimed to be in the right. Azerbaijan had the moral ground (this is our land), while Armenia used the power argument (we won the war). Add to that the long and complicated history of violence against one another.The idea that this problem couldn't be solved through compromise has been prevalent for decades. Therefore, the goal was to make sure the sides didn’t use military force to resolve the conflict. In order to do that, the international community had to monitor the balance of mutual deterrence in the region, so that neither country could hope to win a potential war. For a quarter of a century, this approach worked.However, the world began to change rapidly in the mid-2010s. It became obvious that the liberal order led by the US and Western countries was no longer capable of controlling international relations. There were several contributing factors: from the growing influence of non-Western players and more complexity in the global balance to the crisis inside the Western world itself.As the so-called rules-based mechanism began to lose its power and the global institutions, which support the Western order, started to deteriorate, the demands and ambitions of many other countries became more obvious. Predominantly, these countries felt like the Western-led world order restrained their legitimate aspirations.Thus, a more democratic world emerged. Democratic, not in the sense that there are more democracies, but that different voices are now heard in the international community. We did not see this diversity in the Cold War era, when whatever happened in the international arena was determined by the rules of bipolar confrontation, or immediately after, during the short period of the West’s domination. And in this diverse environment we saw the rise of new powers who were seeking to lead – in the regional context at the very least, and occasionally even at a global level. In the past, their ambition would have been thwarted by superpowers, but that is no longer the case in the 21st century.What do their general musings have to do with Nagorno-Karabakh? Everything. Turkey emerged as an independent and assertive player. Russia, having recovered after the collapse of the USSR, reclaimed a more confident foreign policy, and started reassessing its priorities in a new reality. Azerbaijan managed to stick to a flexible and relatively neutral course, which allowed it to grow its arsenal through multiple channels. All of the above created opportunities for more variations in how this major regional crisis could develop. Eventually, the balance of opportunities changed so much that it enabled a new military scenario — and with a different outcome. Partly it was because Armenia, for example, hadn’t fully realized the scale of those changes.After several weeks of fighting, a truce was brokered. What does it mean?Armenia suffered a heavy defeat, which is bound to have domestic political consequences. It was only Russia’s diplomatic and peace-making efforts that saved it from consequences of a more devastating kind. Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh managed to avoid the worst-case scenarios, but the wound is deep. Now they have to reflect on what happened and find a way to heal — try it the military way again or opt for a new form of nation-building.Azerbaijan didn’t get everything it wanted (i.e. to reintegrate Nagorno-Karabakh), but seized control of strategically important areas and evened the score after its defeat in 1994, which had fueled the nation’s insecurities for years. Baku is unlikely to be satisfied with these results forever, but at this point they are celebrating a victory and the taste of it will last for a while.Turkey scored a win. Not risking a thing, Ankara invested money in equipping Azerbaijan’s army and turned into a major player in the South Caucasus. Under different circumstances, it would not have been able to do so. The partnership-rivalry relations between Russia and Turkey were strengthened through Syria and Libya. It’s a very strange relationship — based not on trust, mutual liking or shared interests, but rather on the understanding that if they oppose each other, neither country can reach its strategic goals. That’s why they have to somehow negotiate and minimize tensions. It’s an extremely confrontational kind of cooperation, but a surprisingly productive one.Russia’s actions were uncharacteristically elegant. Moscow’s ties with Yerevan strengthened: Armenia now depends on Russia more than it did before the war. Russia’s relationship with Azerbaijan is not ruined either, since Moscow played the role of a useful intermediary rather than solely the enemy’s ally. With Turkey, the relations became more complicated, but proved their effectiveness. In the long term, Turkey’s presence in the Caucasus might lead to certain challenges, but there was no way to avoid that. And Russia’s military presence in this strategically important region has grown, which is a good thing.What we saw was a kind of a Great Game of the 21st century on a regional level, with moderate losses and relatively low stakes. On a global scale, though, the outcome is more significant. During the Cold War, any regional conflict was part of the rivalry between the two superpowers. No conflict played out without them participating in it in some form or another. After the Cold War, the United States became “the neighbor to every country on Earth” (the expression was introduced by Askar Akayev, former president of Kyrgyzstan). America and its European allies thought that they had to participate in every conflict resolution — directly or through Western-led institutions like the OSCE, the EU, or NATO. It made sense, since the world order was based on the principles of liberal globalization, established by the West.The peaceful settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh (and before that, the military and diplomatic efforts around Syria and Libya) is an example of a process that only involves those who are directly affected by it, those for whom it is vitally important to find a solution. Indeed, it turns out that in certain cases it is a lot more efficient, as all parties get down to business without dancing around the issue. And they don’t burden the process with too much ideology, which overloaded liberal institutions after the Cold War. This is not the ultimate remedy, of course, but had the conflict resolution in Nagorno-Karabakh continued to rely on the OSCE Minsk Group, nobody would have found a way out of the dark dead end.There are no illusions or euphoria. Nothing is over. However, there is now a roadmap that seems more realistic in today’s world — harsh and fragmented, but still closely connected.;N
RU;‘Nikol is a traitor’: Armenian opposition parties lead protest in crisis-hit Yerevan, demand resignation of PM Pashinyan;Over a thousand protesters have gathered in Yerevan to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan following the Nagorno-Karabakh peace deal. They are accusing him of being a traitor for signing a truce with Baku.In the early hours of Tuesday morning, Pashinyan announced that the country had agreed to end hostilities with Azerbaijan, following a bloody conflict which began in late September. After repeatedly claiming that Armenia was winning the war, he is now coming under attack for what many locals see as a surrender.On Wednesday afternoon, demonstrators met in the center of Yerevan, chanting “Nikol is a traitor.” Led by politicians from a wide range of opposition parties, the protest has brought together Armenians who disagree with the government's decision to end the conflict. Eyewitness reports suggest that the police have arrested individual protest leaders, but the participants have continued undeterred. MP Gagik Tsarukyan, the head of Prosperous Armenia, the country's second-biggest party, was detained by law enforcement.Earlier this week, the leaders of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Russia signed a joint statement agreeing to a truce in Nagorno-Karabakh. The agreement states that Azerbaijani and Armenian troops must remain in their current positions, an arrangement which is to be enforced by Russian peacekeepers. This means that Baku will keep the areas of Nagorno-Karabakh it regained control of during the conflict. According to Pashinyan, Yerevan had no choice, as the country's resources were quickly becoming depleted.On September 27, the frozen conflict suddenly erupted once again. The dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia is decades old, with both countries believing they have legitimate claims to the territory. The region is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan but is primarily populated by ethnic Armenians. Baku had always considered the enclave to be illegally occupied by Yerevan.;E
RU;Press release on Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s telephone conversation with Foreign Minister of the Republic of Armenia Ara Ayvazyan;On December 23, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke by phone with Foreign Minister of the Republic of Armenia Ara Ayvazyan.The foreign ministers discussed issues related to the implementation of the November 9 statement by President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan on the ceasefire in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict zone, as well as a number of topical items on the bilateral and international agenda.;N
RU;ADDRESS by the Ambassador of the Russian Federation to Ireland Yuriy Filatov to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence December 17, 2020;The recent settlement of the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh could be considered as an example of the above-mentioned approach. The November 9 agreement reached by the leaders of Russia, Azerbaijan and Armenia stopped the bloodshed and paved the way for a long-term settlement. Due to the Agreement, thousands of internally displaced persons and refugees have returned to their households and secured conditions for the process of rebuilding of the economy and solution of the humanitarian problems. Now we can create real conditions to turn the region of the Southern Caucasus from the instability and internal tense contradictions into the place of stability and flourishing in the interests of all peoples living there and Russia will continue persistently support an advancement in this direction.;N
RU;Briefing by Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, Moscow, December 16, 2020;Question: Azerbaijan and Armenia agreed to an exchange of prisoners based on the all-for-all principle, and this exchange took place with the mediation of Russian peacekeepers. Can this process be considered complete or is it still underway?Maria Zakharova:  Yesterday, the commander of the Russian peacekeeping forces in Nagorno-Karabakh, Lieutenant General Rustam Muradov, spoke in detail about the all-for-all prisoner exchange between Baku and Yerevan. “In accordance with the trilateral statement by the leaders of Russia, Azerbaijan and Armenia of November 9 of this year, an all-for-all prisoner exchange took place. This was preceded by extensive preparatory work carried out by Russian peacekeeping forces with the Azerbaijani and Armenian sides. Twelve people were brought to Baku by the airplane of the Russian aerospace forces and handed over to representatives of the Azerbaijani competent authorities. The Azerbaijani side returned 44 prisoners, who arrived at the Erebuni Airport. Russian peacekeepers will continue to contribute to the strict implementation of the trilateral agreement.”on the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement in the post-conflict period? What tasks will the Group solve at the moment and in the future, given that it was Russia that contributed to the resolution of the conflict? Wouldn’t it be more effective for the three countries – Russia, Azerbaijan and Armenia – to solve the emerging issues? Is it any good seeing the work of the Minsk Group as trying to implement the trilateral leaders’ statement of November 9 of this year? Perhaps it could better contribute to addressing the issues that could be resolved later within the framework of this statement? In particular, this was recorded in the statement of the heads of delegations of the OSCE Minsk Group co-chair countries on December 3 of this year following the Ministerial Council in Tirana. It was noted that Azerbaijan and Armenia will have to work out a long-term and sustainable peace agreement and resolve all remaining issues. What specific tasks does the Minsk Group face in this regard?Maria Zakharova:   I would like to recommend contacting the OSCE Minsk Group.Given the scope of the statement adopted on November 9 by the leaders of the three states, at this stage, the process of its implementation is underway, on the one hand. On the other hand, the adjustment of all international bodies and organisations is underway that should resolve issues within their powers and competence.Time is needed to coordinate and institutionalise these processes. That’s what everyone is working on at the moment. The region is facing a great number of problems. They relate to completely different areas: humanitarian issues, the return of refugees, protection of cultural sites, security, mine clearance, and a lot more. At this stage, the process of fine tuning each aspect of the settlement in all their complexity is underway.It should be understood that the OSCE Minsk Group, as well as other international entities and intermediary organisations (for example, the ICRC), which can play a role in a full-scale settlement, are currently engaged in determining the areas of focus and steps that should be taken.Question: On December 12-13, the Azerbaijani army broke the ceasefire in the western part of the Hadrut District. There are wounded on the Armenian side. Isn’t this outbreak aimed at discrediting Russia’s peacekeeping mission, thus questioning the trilateral statement?Maria Zakharova: Russia is doing everything in its power to achieve lasting and strong peace in the region. We proceed from the fact that both sides in the conflict share the same goals.Question: As part of their regional visit, the co-chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group arrived in Baku on December 12. President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev said he had not invited them. Does his harsh tone mean that Azerbaijan is trying to discredit the OSCE Minsk Group? Why did Co-Chair of the OSCE Minsk Group Igor Popov not go?Maria Zakharova: Questions about Azerbaijan’s actions should be addressed to Baku.Russia was represented in Yerevan and Baku by its Ambassador to Azerbaijan Mikhail Bocharnikov and Acting Charge d’Affaires in Armenia Alexander Sinegubov. I don’t think I should go into detail as to why the Russian delegation was comprised like this. There were reasons for this but no conspiracy at all. Don’t look for deep political subtext there.Back to topQuestion: Vice-Speaker of the Azerbaijani Parliament Adil Aliyev said the Russian peacekeepers had no right to protect the villages that Turkish-Azerbaijani troops had tried to seize the day before. “Russia has no right to interfere with the Azeri special services’ antiterrorist operation in Nagorno-Karabakh and will suffer significant losses together with Armenia,” he posted on his Facebook account. Can you comment on these statements?Maria Zakharova: We have offered our commentaries many times in the context of other statements by different political figures. We proceed from the assumption that all the statements made by parties to the conflict (although I would prefer calling them parties to the settlement process) and other regional and outside players should be aimed at achieving the main goal: lasting peace and a comprehensive settlement. Each and every statement should be viewed in terms of what benefit it can bring or what harm it can do.A lot of important and very difficult work has been done, and every word must be weighed to understand why it is being uttered.Everything regarding specific details: authority, situation on the ground, practical duties, and areas of responsibility – all these issues can and must be addressed by the sides on the operating level. We stay in touch with both Baku and Yerevan via existing channels. All issues must be address in this manner.;E
RU;As for Nagorno-Karabakh, we acted on a desire to put an end to the bloodshed. The conflicting parties – Armenia and Azerbaijan – expressed an interest in doing this with Russia’s mediation. We had no hidden agenda.;Incidentally, I do not remember our Iranian colleagues ever indicating their interest or raising the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh at the numerous consultations and talks we have held during my term as foreign minister of Russia.This does not mean that we have no regard for Iran’s interests. We are aware of Iran’s concern about the effect the normalisation of Azerbaijan-Armenia ties can have on its transit interests, which is becoming increasingly important considering that the Americans have adopted sanctions against Iran and continue to increase them. But we cannot abandon the main principle that has been generally upheld for many years: the outcome of the conflict must be the normalisation of relations throughout the region.The joint Statement signed by the leaders of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia on November 9, 2020 sets out the main guidelines that are also present in the Iranian peace initiative made at the height of the conflict.There is no use talking about who and when managed or did not manage to bring about a settlement. I would like to emphasise again that the choice of the format was made by Azerbaijan and Armenia. It was this, and this alone that determined the format of the signatories to the statement. No attempts were made or could be made to attain this goal at the expense of Iran or Turkey. What we must think about now is what else can be done to ensure full implementation of the agreements and to turn the region from an area of confrontation into a region of coexistence, or better still, a region of neighbourly relations and cooperation.When President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan was in Baku the other day, he made a statement in which he mentioned the possibility of cooperation between the three South Caucasus states – Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia – and their three neighbours – Iran, Turkey and Russia. This is obvious. We are all neighbours, and now that problems between the South Caucasus states are being settled we as their neighbours should contribute to this process.;A
SE;Agreement finalised on Nagorno-Karabakh;"Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia have signed an agreement to end fighting over the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh.This is stated by both The Prime Minister of Armenia, Nikol Pasjinjan, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.Pasjinjan writes in a message on Facebook that the agreement is ""extremely painful for me personally and for our people"" but that the decision was made after an analysis of the current state of the ongoing fighting and that ""this is the best solution"".Just an hour after the agreement was signed, thousands of demonstrators gathered outside the headquarters of the Armenian Government in the capital Yerevan. Eyewitnesses tell the AFP news agency that a few hundred of them stormed the government building, shattered windows and destroyed several offices.Russian peace forcesThe agreement entered into force after midnight the night of Tuesday local time. According to Putin – whose Russia has a military pact with Armenia – the new agreement represents a total ceasefire in the disputed region.The agreement, if it is held, would put an end to a six-week armed conflict. Between 1 000 and 1 200 people have been confirmed dead as a result of the conflict, but the number of casualties is believed to be higher.The Russian Defense Ministry said in a separate statement that it will send 1,960 people as a peacekeeping force to the region. Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev says that Turkey – which supports Azerbaijan – will also participate in the peacekeeping mission.On Monday, the Armenia-backed government in Nagorno-Karabakh confirmed the loss of the strategically important town of Sjusha, having initially denied it.Aliyev announced the news on Sunday, whereupon crowds gathered in the streets of the Azeri capital Baku and waved flags.Sjusja is located at an altitude above the largest resort of Stepanakert and Azeri forces were said to have their sights set on it.Russian helicopter shot downEarlier on Monday evening, Russian and Armenian authorities reported that a Russian military helicopter had been shot down in Armenia, near the town of Jerash, which is near the border with the Azeri exclave of Nachitjevan.Shortly after the shooting was announced, Azerbaijan stepped forward and claimed responsibility. The country's Foreign Ministry states that it was done by mistake and in the evening presented an apology to Russia with an offer of financial redress.Two people were killed and one injured in the shooting.";N
SE;Nagorno-Karabakh fighting despite agreement;The ceasefire in the conflict over the Caucasian splinter region of Nagorno-Karabakh was short-lived.Both the Armenian and The Azeri side accuse each other of attacks.In the Armenian-controlled Nagorno-Karabakh, 37 soldiers were killed on Sunday, according to Russian news agency Interfax.Azerbaijan did not give any death toll.Armenia, which supports Nagorno-Karabakh in the conflict, and Azerbaijan, to which the breakaway region formally belongs, agreed a ceasefire at midnight on Sunday. The announcement came after a fragile ceasefire under mediation by Russia collapsed.At least 36 civilians have been killed on the Armenian side, while 60 have been killed on the Azeri side since fighting flared up on September 27, according to the respective parties.On the Armenian side, 673 soldiers have been killed, according to the breakaway region's official figures. The Azeri side has not presented any official statistics on soldiers killed.;N
SE;Armenia must withdraw its troops;Reply from Sweden's young Azerbaijanis about the conflict in Nagorno-KarabakhReplica. You state that Azerbaijan is a dictatorship. However, Azerbaijan's current statehood has nothing to do with the ongoing conflict.Armenia went on the offensive back in July, north of the conflict zone to strike at the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, which transports oil to Europe.Azerbaijan's economy is dependent on oil exports, and the attack led to tensions rising and resulting in war in late September. There is national consensus over Azerbajdzan's struggle to repel Armenia's aggression. All political parties have united behind the country's stance. The peace that now prevails can be compared to the situation in Sweden when all parties stood united behind the crackdown in the fight against covid at the beginning of the year.You also write that Turkey supports Azerbaijan and brings terrorists from Syria. Turkey, of course, supports Azerbajzdjan's struggle, but not a single Turkish soldier is currently fighting in Azerbaijan. Syrian terrorists are entirely the product of Armenian propaganda, and there has been no evidence to the contrary.What is not mentioned in the article is that Armenia receives free arms and political support from Russia, not to mention the support of the well-off Armenian diaspora in the United States and France. There is also evidence that the citizens of other countries are fighting on armenia's side.The most important thing that you are silent about, however, is that the fighting continues entirely on azerbaijan's internationally recognised territory. The THIRD UN resolution calls for Armenia to immediately withdraw its troops from there.In the 1990s, Armenia expelled all Azerbaijanis who lived there. My family, too, was forced to flee Kelbadjar, one of the 7 districts around Nagorno-Karabakh occupied by Armenia and where Azerbaijanis were the majority. For 27 years, I've been dying to see my home area again.Among those displaced were also many Kurds. In total, nearly 800 000 people were displaced from the area.We want to return the refugees home so that Azerbaijanis and Armenians can live side by side again.Mahira Mukhtarova, spokesperson for SUAZ (Sweden's young Azerbaijanis);A
SE;EU investigates war crimes in Nagorno-Karabakh;"The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan has intensified in Nagorno-Karabakh.Now the Council of Europe says it has launched an investigation into suspected war crimes – after two videos appearing to show an execution were published on the internet, according to the BBC.In the first video, Azeri troops are seen capturing two people who look like they are dressed in Armenian military uniforms. In the second clip, the two men are shot in the head while having their hands behind their backs.Armenian authorities say they have identified the two men, but Azerbaijan denies the information, calling the clips a provocation.However, the BBC has managed to verify that the man giving command of the shooting speaks with a local Azeridialect. And they have also managed to find several indications that the clips were recorded in Hadrut in southern Nagorno-Karabakh.""Hollywood gives a bad reflection""On the internet, many people questioned the authenticity of the videos as there is not much blood when the men are shot.But military experts say the amount of blood is consistent with real shootings.""Hollywood gives a bad reflection of what gunshot wounds look like,"" Rob Lee, an expert in war studies at Kings College in London, told the BBC.Several clips questionedMany images and videos are circulating online that claim to show war crimes from Nagorno-Karabakh, but the BBC has only been able to verify the contents of the two clips from Hadrut.In some cases, these should be events from other locations. Among other things, a video clip has been circulated on the Telegram app that claims to show How Azeri prisoners are shot dead by Armenian troops.However, this clip is supposed to be from 2013 and recorded in Russia, according to the BBC.";N

The ceasefire has been broken again.The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan has been going on for decades, but it was at the end of September that fighting began anew.On Saturday last week, the countries agreed on a ceasefire during a meeting in Moscow with Russia as a mediator, but on the same day there were reports that it had been broken and in the evening seven powerful explosions were heard. Both parties have blamed each other for violating the agreement, AFP reported.Bloodiest fighting since the region broke freeThe Ombudsman for Human Rights in Karabakh, Artak Beglaryan, wrote on Twitter after Friday's bombings:""Azerbaijan just struck Stepanakert with heavy missiles for the first time today. They continue to attack civilian points while international communities continue with empty words and statements.""Earlier on Friday, Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev said the army had ""liberated"" several villages, on Twitter.Armenia and Azerbaijan both make historic claims to Nagorno-Karabakh, which today formally belongs to Azerbaijan – but the majority of the inhabitants are Armenians. Nagorno-Karabakh declared independence in 1991, but it has not been recognized by the outside world.The battles of recent weeks are the bloodiest since that time.

SW;Swiss call for an end to violence in Nagorno-Karabakh;The Swiss foreign ministry has called for an immediate stop to the violence in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. It has also allocated CHF1 million ($1.1 million) to the humanitarian operations of the Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).“Attacks on the civilian population and civilian objects must cease. The parties to the conflict are called upon to comply with international humanitarian law,” the ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.The contribution was being made in response to an appeal by the ICRC, it said.“Furthermore, the ministry expresses Switzerland’s regret that the humanitarian ceasefires of October 10 and 17 have not been respected. It reiterates its call to the parties to the conflict to stop the violence and condemns the ongoing shelling of residential areas.”Observance of the principles of distinction and proportionality were paramount, it added. “This also means that cluster munitions must not be used, as such weapons do not make any distinction between civilians and combatants.”Will the United Nations soon be obsolete?Is the international order capable of meeting the enormous challenges facing states and societies around the world?The Swiss government said that it was only through peaceful means that a lasting solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict could be found. The foreign ministry therefore called on both parties to the conflict “to resume meaningful negotiations without delay or preconditions”.;N
SW;What’s the chance for diplomacy in Nagorno-Karabakh?;"Since September 27, fighting between Armenians and Azerbaijanis in the Nagorno-Karabakh region has intensified. It is the rekindling of an old conflict in which diplomatic efforts, including those of Switzerland, have never led to a settlement.This is the most serious violation of a 1994 ceasefire that followed a six-year war between the two sides. The number of dead and wounded is hard to know, as is the number of civilians fleeing the fighting. But the casualties are in the hundreds.  ""We can already see the terrible impact that this escalation of the conflict is having on the civilian population,"" said Gerardo Moloeznik on October 2. He is the head of a sub-delegation of the International Committee of the Red Cross located in Barda, Azerbaijan. The Geneva-headquartered ICRC warns that large numbers of people fleeing the conflict are likely, in addition, to fuel the spread of Covid-19 as winter approaches. Ceasefire calls unheededThe numerous calls to stop the fighting – whether from the UN Security Council, OSCE, Moscow, Paris, Washington or Bern – have so far failed to curb military escalation.   “The multilateral system and the big powers are realising once again that diplomacy has its limits,” says Keith Krause, director of the Centre on Conflict, Development and Peacebuilding at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva. For its part, Switzerland has said it is ""ready to host meetings at the highest level” and that “the parties to the conflict must respect their obligations under international law, particularly international humanitarian law, and resume peace negotiations without conditions,"" according to foreign ministry spokesman Georg Farago.  An unresolved conflict The antagonism between Armenians and Azerbaijanis goes back a long way. The end of the First World War – marked in the region by the Armenian genocide perpetrated by Ottoman Turkey – allowed them to establish in 1918 two states on the ruins of the Russian Empire. Then incorporated into the Soviet Union, their territorial claims were frozen by Moscow. However, the claims of both sides were reborn in 1988 in the Soviet Union’s dying days with the first phase of the war in Nagorno-Karabakh, a region with an Armenian majority that declared independence in 1991. A ceasefire put an end to military operations in 1994, but periodic clashes have continued along the demarcation line.    ""At the time of the break-up of the USSR, both Armenia and Azerbaijan formally committed themselves to respect the existing borders,"" says Marcelo Kohen, professor of international law at the Graduate Institute. “Nagorno-Karabakh was an autonomous region within Azerbaijan. And no member of the United Nations recognised its independence.""  This is far from the only conflict troubling the former Soviet republics, Kohen says. He points to the examples of Abkhazia and South Ossetia having declared independence from Georgia, Transnistria from the Republic of Moldova, the Crimea’s separation from Ukraine, and Donetsk and Luhansk declaring independence from Ukraine. ""In none of these situations has the principle of peoples’ right to self-determination been recognised for existing national minorities within the States concerned – even though these States have an obligation to respect the rights of minorities.""  The result was a series of conflicts where numerous world powers got involved.  Regional powers complicate the pictureWhile  United States and European Union meddling in former Soviet states has often been denounced, including in Western media, they are not the only ones practising double standards, according to Kohen.  ""Turkey supports the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan but violates this same principle in the Republic of Cyprus, supporting the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus,” he says. “Some Western political leaders call loud and clear for the respect of the territorial integrity of Ukraine but have ignored it in relation to Serbia in Kosovo. Russia has defended it for Serbia but ignored it for Ukraine.""  Krause says that Turkey’s appearance on the scene and its increasingly strong-arm diplomacy confirm a lasting trend where ""the regional powers have more room for manoeuvre than in the past to get involved in conflicts and increase their sphere of influence.""  This Turkish interventionism poses an additional problem for two institutions active in the region. ""One is the OSCE [Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe], which has so far failed to revive talks,” says political science professor Krause. “The other is NATO, of which Turkey is a member. With its offensive policy, we are approaching a breaking point within NATO.""  What chance for diplomacy?  So how can peace be achieved in Nagorno-Karabakh? Marcelo Kohen thinks the solution lies in withdrawal of foreign interference, and an end to hostilities. ""The OSCE is the appropriate framework for carrying out negotiations, as in the past,"" he says. Kohen also stresses the importance of respect for international humanitarian law, the territorial integrity of states, and the need to grant broad autonomy in Nagorno-Karabakh under international guarantee. Farago of the Swiss Foreign Ministry recalls the Zurich Protocols, an agreement signed by Ankara and Yerevan in 2009 to restore diplomatic relations between Turkey and Armenia and reopen the common border. ""To date, the Zurich Protocols are the only documents that contain concrete proposals for the normalisation of relations between Armenia and Turkey and that have been signed by representatives of the Armenian and Turkish governments,” he says. “However, ratification by the parliaments of Yerevan and Ankara has not yet taken place.""  A first meeting on Nagorno-Karabakh was held in Geneva on Thursday, under the auspices of the OSCE's Minsk group, co-presided by France, the US and Russia. And at the invitation of Russian President Vladimir Poutine, the foreign affairs ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan began talks in Moscow on Friday on the separatist region.";N
SW;Swiss urge peace in Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict;Switzerland says it is concerned about ongoing violent clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan that have been intensifying since September 27.  “In the light of recent events, Switzerland calls on all parties to preserve regional stability and therefore end the use of force,” Bern said in a press release on Monday. It also urged both sides to “uphold their obligations under international law, in particular to protect the civilian population”.  “Substantive negotiations must be resumed immediately and without preconditions,” added the statement. “Switzerland fully supports the efforts of the Co-Chairs of the Minsk Group towards a negotiated conflict solution and is ready to host meetings at the highest level, as has been done in the past.” The OSCE’s Minsk Group spearheads the regional organisation’s efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh territorial dispute, which is at the heart of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. It is co-chaired by France, Russia, and the United States. Nagorno-Karabakh is recognised as part of Azerbaijan but has been controlled by ethnic Armenians since a war ended in 1994.  Switzerland is an active promoter of peace in the region. It is supporting mediation efforts for the conflict in eastern Ukraine and has a mandate to represent the diplomatic interests of Russia in Georgia and vice-versa. Bern also recently upgraded its diplomatic presence in Belarus.  ;N

He noted that unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and manned aircraft will carry out surveillance missions over the area to ensure there are no violations.""We will stand beside Azerbaijan and support them however they would like us to,"" Çavuşoğlu said.The foreign minister also noted that Turkey hopes Armenia has learned its lesson to not attack other countries' territory.""The Minsk trio also needs to learn a lesson in this process,"" he added.Criticizing France for taking sides during the conflict, Çavuşoğlu said Paris has shown why co-chairs have not been able to solve the three-decade-long conflict.""France has not displayed an objective, balanced attitude. Despite Azerbaijan's positive stance, France has always continued to support Armenia and continues to maintain its negative stance after the cease-fire,"" he said.Relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan have been tense since 1991 when the Armenian military occupied Nagorno-Karabakh, a territory recognized internationally as part of Azerbaijan.Fresh clashes erupted on Sept. 27, and the Armenian Army continued its attacks on civilians and Azerbaijani forces, even violating humanitarian cease-fire agreements, for 44 days.Baku liberated several cities and nearly 300 of its settlements and villages from Armenian occupation during that time.On Nov. 10, the two countries signed a Russia-brokered agreement to end fighting and work toward a comprehensive solution for the conflict.Turkey has welcomed the truce, which is a result of Baku's military successes and has given it an upper hand over Yerevan to resolve the three-decade dispute.";A
TR;Statement of the Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Hami Aksoy, in Response to a Question Regarding the Armenian Attacks on Azerbaijan Which Started This Morning;We learnt that Armenian Armed Forces launched an intense shelling with heavy arms on Azerbaijani army, in Kapanlı village of Tartar district, Çıraklı and Ortakerbent villages of Aghdam district, Alhanlı and Şükürbeyli villages of Aghdam district and Çocukmercanlı village of Cebrayıl district in violation of the ceasefire along the contact line.We strongly condemn the Armenian attacks which constitute a clear violation of international law and caused civilian casualties. With these attacks, Armenia once again displayed that it is the biggest obstacle to peace and stability in the region.Azerbaijan will surely use its right of self defence to protect its people and its territorial integrity. In this vein, Turkey fully supports Azerbaijan with unwavering solidarity. We will stand by Azerbaijan whichever way it prefers.We call on the international community also to stand by the righteous party.Hereby, we wish Allah’s mercy upon Azerbaijani martyrs who lost their lives, wish a speedy recovery to the wounded and convey our condolences to the brotherly Azerbaijan.;A
TR;Press Release Regarding Armenia’s Attacks on Ganja City of Azerbaijan;Armenia’s attacks today, targeting the civilian population in Ganja, the second largest city of Azerbaijan, are a new manifestation of Armenia's disregard of law. We condemn these attacks. Facing defeat in the Azerbaijani territories it occupied, Armenia attacks the civilian settlements beyond the regions that are scene of armed confrontations because of its occupation, in violation of all principles of humanitarian law, first and foremost the Geneva Conventions. These attacks are an indication of the desperation of Armenia and that it will not shy away from committing crimes against humanity in order to continue its illegal occupation. As we have said since the beginning, Armenia is the biggest obstacle to peace and stability in the region.We support the stance of the Azerbaijani administration which has announced that it will not respond to Armenia’s provocations, that it is exercising its right of self-defense arising from international law within its internationally recognized borders and that it is making every possible effort to prevent harm to the civilian population.;A
TR;Press Release Regarding Armenia’s Anew Attack Today on Barda City of Azerbaijan;After yesterday's heinous attack, Armenia perpetrated yet another vicious and treacherous attack on civilians in the Azerbaijani city of Barda, outside the conflict zone. According to initial reports, 21 people lost their lives and more than 70 were wounded as a result of the attack.We wish Allah’s mercy upon our brothers and sisters who lost their lives, a speedy recovery to the wounded, and convey our condolences and wishes of fortitude to brotherly Azerbaijan.We condemn in the strongest possible terms Armenia’s vile attacks directed against the civilian population including children, the young and the elderly without discrimination. This vicious policy Armenia employs to terrorize and murder civilians is another manifestation of the sick mindset that was behind the Khojaly massacre.The Armenian administration, resorting to any means available to avoid withdrawing from the territories it occupied, acts without reason and conscience. This latest attack is registered as a shameful entry in the list of Armenia’s war crimes for which it will be held accountable.It is long overdue for the international community, particularly for the Minsk Group Co-chairs, to show the necessary reaction to Armenia.;A
TR;Statement of the Spokesperson of Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Hami Aksoy, to a Question Regarding the Ceasefire Declared Today Between Azerbaijan and Armenia and Its Violation;The ceasefires declared on October 10 and October 18 after the clashes that started following the attack of Armenia against Azerbaijan, were breached by Armenia in a short time. Lastly, as a result of the initiatives of the USA, today a ceasefire was declared again for the exchange of prisoners of war and remains of soldiers. Unfortunately, this last ceasefire was also violated by Armenia within minutes, and Armenia continued its attacks against both the Azerbaijani positions on the front line and civilian targets deep in Azerbaijan far from the conflict zone.For the efforts of the Minsk Group Co-Chairs to yield concrete results, we deem it necessary that they take into account the violations of Armenia and initiate a result-oriented negotiation process aiming at a lasting solution in accordance with the UN Security Council Resolutions and international law. We believe only then the declared ceasefires would become sustainable.;A
TR;Azerbaijan, Armenia exchange bodies of soldiers;"Azerbaijan receives bodies of 6 Azerbaijani martyrs, says Defense MinistryBAKU Azerbaijan and Armenia on Saturday exchanged the bodies of soldiers, who died in the clashes around the city of Susha in Upper Karabakh region, the Azerbaijan’s Defense Ministry said.In a statement, the ministry said the bodies of soldiers were collected through the intermediary and participation of the Russian peacekeeping forces stationed in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan.""As part of this humanitarian action, the bodies of the dead servicemen of the Armenian armed forces were collected and handed over to the Armenian side,"" said the statement.""Also, within the framework of this action, the bodies of six servicemen of the Azerbaijan Army, who became Shehids (martyrs) during the battles around the Shusha city, were received.""The statement also expressed gratitude to Russia’s Defense Ministry and Sergei Shiogu, the Russian defense minister, for organizing the humanitarian action.Relations between the former Soviet republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia have been tense since 1991, when the Armenian military occupied Nagorno-Karabakh, also known as Upper Karabakh, a territory recognized as part of Azerbaijan, and seven adjacent regions.Fresh clashes erupted on Sept. 27, and the Armenian army continued its attacks on civilian and Azerbaijani forces, even violating humanitarian cease-fire agreements for 44 days.Baku liberated several cities and nearly 300 of its settlements and villages from Armenian occupation during this time.On Nov. 10, the two countries signed a Russia-brokered agreement to end the fighting and work towards a comprehensive resolution.​​​​​​​Turkey welcomed the truce, terming it a ""great victory"" for Azerbaijan.";A
TR;Azerbaijan’s campaign in Nagorno-Karabakh: Big victory and big lessons;Azerbaijan gets to keep military gains, regional geopolitics shift and cooperation gets a boost.In the wee hours of November 10, 2020, Armenia’s Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan announced via Facebook that he signed an agreement to end the war in Nagorno-Karabakh with immediate effect. Both sides will keep their current territorial locations as part of the accord, which means Azerbaijan will preserve the military gains it has accomplished since the beginning of the conflict. At the same time, Armenia will return other occupied territories it currently controls. This process will take place in phases over the next month.The recent capture of Shusha by Azerbaijan’s army made the fall of the region’s capital, Stepanakert, inevitable, thus forcing Armenia to accept the terms of the ceasefire. This deal is a successful outcome for Azerbaijan as it retrieved large chunks of its territories illegally occupied by Armenia for three decades. Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev said the agreement was of “historic importance,” and amounted to a “capitulation” by Armenia. Turkey’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Mevlut Cavusoglu was quick to congratulate Azerbaijan’s leadership via Twitter: “The brotherly Azerbaijan has achieved an important gain on the battleground and [negotiating] table. I sincerely congratulate this sacred success.” The Karabakh conflict evolved from communal unrest in 1988-1990 and small-scale civil war involving rag-tag militias and irregular units in 1991 to an all-out war between two newly established states in 1992-1994. Since Baku inherited an underfunded and dispirited military force from the Soviet Era, it was not able to stop Armenia’s aggression. Such a defeat and the subsequent loss of territories left a deep wound in Azerbaijan’s common consciousness. Without addressing this wrong, Azerbaijan’s state identity was always deemed incomplete. Also, Baku dealt with a massive humanitarian catastrophe as hundreds of thousands of displaced persons moved from Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding districts to Azerbaijan.Fast forward three decades later, and Baku has upped its game on several levels. Diplomatically, President Ilham Aliyev enhanced relations with Turkey significantly, and the two governments developed a remarkable synergy. Aliyev also maintained a good relationship with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin. Aliyev did not try to upset the Kremlin and understood Moscow’s red lines in the region. In the Karabakh conflict, Aliyev tried the diplomatic route for a long time and was open to compromise.In contrast, Armenia’s Prime Minister, Pashinyan irked the Kremlin by attempting to insert pro-Western elements within Armenia’s bureaucracy and security services. His administration also opened criminal cases against Russian companies. Moreover, Pashinyan multiplied the provocations and declared his inclination to annex the occupied territories, thereby dashing hopes for a negotiated settlement and paving the way for military escalation. Militarily, Turkey helped Azerbaijan modernise its army. The Turkish army trained the Azerbaijani army, supplied Baku with some of the latest equipment in terms of electronic warfare and armed drones, and helped design an efficient strategy that neutralised Armenia’s arsenal of armoured, mechanised, and motorised formations. As a result, Azerbaijan’s armed forces had the upper hand over the battlespace. Armenia targeted Azerbaijan’s population centres with ballistic missiles to provoke retaliation, which would then trigger a direct Russian involvement as per the agreements signed between Moscow and Yerevan. However, Baku remained focused on the Karabakh operations, thus neutralising any possible Russian direct intervention. Furthermore, the fact that military operations began and ended during the peak of the US elections was a masterstroke as it prevented the potential involvement of the upcoming US administration in this conflict.From a geopolitical standpoint, Azerbaijan’s victory in this war holds several lessons. First, it reflects Turkey’s growing importance on the world stage. In the past few years, Turkey’s allies have benefited from Ankara’s assertive policies. Qatar in 2017, Libya in 2019 and Azerbaijan in 2020 all opted for Ankara as an ally. This move has come with tangible benefits for the nations concerned, allowing them to turn deeply critical situations into a more stable environment conducive for peace. Second, France has been involved in the political process mediated by the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). This platform was highly inefficient and did little to bring peace between both parties. The apathy of the Minsk Group was not just unfair but also prejudicial to Azerbaijan although international law is entirely in favour of the Aliyev government. Even when it became clear that the frozen conflict in Karabakh was about to erupt, France did nothing to bring Armenia back to the negotiating table. On the contrary, Paris supported the aggressive policies of the Armenian government, as French President Emmanuel Macron was hoping to keep Azerbaijan and Turkey at bay. Therefore, Azerbaijan’s victory is an additional failure for Macron, who once more engaged in petty politicking at the expense of international law.Third, Azerbaijan’s victory opens the door for more interregional cooperation. For example, the opening of a land corridor connecting Turkey to Azerbaijan could enable more economic and cultural exchanges with other Turkic countries, namely Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan. All in all, this is a big victory for Azerbaijan. It will certainly be written in golden letters in the history of the country. However, there are some challenges ahead. Many terms of the ceasefire agreement are related to Armenia’s implementation of these clauses. Given Yerevan’s lack of compliance history and popular resentment against Pashinyan’s regime, Baku must remain alert.;A

TR;Press Release Regarding the Armenian Attack on Azerbaijan;We strongly condemn the attack of the Armenian armed forces on Tovuz region of Azerbaijan. We convey our condolences to the friendly and brotherly Azerbaijani people and Government for the Azerbaijani martyrs who lost their lives, and wish speedy recovery to the wounded.The fact that this attack which is yet another manifestation of Armenia's aggressive nationalism, has been repelled by Azerbaijan, is a concrete indication that aggression will not be left unanswered.These attempts, which Armenia has made to distract the attention of the international community from its continued illegal occupation of Azerbaijani territory Nagorno Karabakh and its surrounding regions for many years and to add new dimensions to the conflict for blocking the political settlement, are bound to fail.The Armenian side should give up on such dangerous tactics and choose the path of reason and law. Embarking on adventurism for aspirations beyond its own capacity reveals Armenia’s failure of judgement and constitutes the biggest obstacle to peace and stability in our region.We hope that Armenia’s effort to cover up its own aggression will not be accepted by the international community in any way.Turkey will continue, with all its capacity, to stand by Azerbaijan in its struggle to protect its territorial integrity.;A
TR;Press Release Regarding the Ceasefire Between Azerbaijan and Armenia;A ceasefire has been declared between Azerbaijan and Armenia on the front line to take effect today at 12:00 local time.During the armed conflicts that started on 27 September 2020, Azerbaijan has shown Armenia and the whole world that it has the ability and the self confidence to reclaim its territories under occupation for nearly 30 years.In this process, calls for ceasefire were made from all over the world with humanitarian considerations. Consequently Azerbaijan gave Armenia a last opportunity to withdraw from the territories it has occupied.The ceasefire which was declared on humanitarian grounds for the exchange of prisoners of war and bodies, is an important first step, but cannot replace a lasting solution. Since the beginning, Turkey has always underlined that it would only support those solutions which were acceptable to Azerbaijan. With this understanding, Turkey will continue to stand by brotherly Azerbaijan on the ground and at the table.;A
TR;Press Release Regarding Armenia’s Attacks on Terter City of Azerbaijan;We strongly condemn the continuing attacks of Armenia on civilian settlements in Azerbaijan. As a result of Armenia’s latest attack on Terter today, three civilians lost their lives and five others were wounded while they were attending a funeral ceremony.Armenia continues to disregard the humanitarian ceasefire declared on 10 October for the exchange of prisoners of war and bodies of the dead. Showing no traits of humanity, Armenia does not even let our Azerbaijani brothers lay their beloveds to rest.With this latest attack, Armenia once again demonstrated to the whole world its total disrespect for humanitarian values and laws.Turkey stands with brotherly Azerbaijan in full and eternal solidarity.;A
TR;Press Release Regarding Armenia’s Attack on Barda City of Azerbaijan;Armenia’s ongoing attacks against civilian settlements outside the conflict zone in Azerbaijan despite the ceasefire announced yesterday (October 26) trample all universal humanitarian and moral values.Today at the evening, the attack by the Armenian armed forces on the city of Barda killed four civilians including a 2-year-old child and wounded 13 others. We wish Allah’s mercy upon our brothers and sisters who lost their lives, a speedy recovery to the wounded and convey our condolences to the people of Azerbaijan.We condemn in the strongest possible terms this heinous attack by Armenia and invite all countries with a conscience and responsibility to call on Armenia to stop the war crimes it continues to commit.Despite the fact that all three ceasefires declared to this day through the initiatives of the Minsk Group Co-Chairs were violated each time by Armenia, we find it noteworthy that the countries of the Co-Chairs did not give any reaction to these violations.;A
UA;Cuts through Caucasus: What Ukraine and Russia need to keep in mind when observing Armenian surrender;"Armenia has surrendered. What exactly did the winners and the losers agree on and why did Russia so easily give up on its allies, and will Armenians and Azerbaijanis be able to coexist peacefully after the bloody confrontation?As convoys of peacekeepers move on, soldiers see dozens of dead bodies in camouflaged uniform. Those fighters died in the battle for the fortress city of Shusha – the battle that put an end to this bloody territorial confrontation. It is this eerie footage that's the true face of war.He who controls Shusha controls all of Karabakh. The strategic city was considered impenetrable. However, on November 9, after several days of fierce hostilities, the Azerbaijani flag was hoisted over the city. Until the last moment, Armenians had hoped to get support from Russia.""Why did our Putin give up on us?"" An Armenian soldier asks, in Russian.The Kremlin chief has the answer. Turkey's open support for Azerbaijan in this conflict has raised the stakes and finished off Russian influence in the Caucasus. Vladimir Putin did not dare to cross the line drawn by Recep Tayyip Erdogan.But there was another motive. Armenian Prime Minister Pashinyan, whom Kremlin loathes. He came to power as a result of the revolution, displacing Russia's puppet. Now he's done, definitely. It was after the conversation with the Russian president that Pashinyan signed the deal, which his Azerbaijani counterpart, without hiding his emotions, called surrender on the part of the adversary.""In this paper – not a word about the status of Nagorno Karabakh. So what, Pashinyan? What, where is your status? To hell with your status! There is no status, and there won't be any! As long as I am president, there'll be no status. This is a part of Azerbaijan,"" Ilham Aliyev said.The streets of Azerbaijani cities have turned into human rivers, on the waves of which, to the sounds of songs and dances, float the colors of the national flag… This is victory.And this is how the defeat looks like: outraged by the sudden surrender, the crowd storms the Armenian parliament, smashes furniture and assaults speaker.Armenians are enraged. They don't understand why thousands of young lives have been lost. ""We don't want it this way. We want to fight to the end,"" protesters say at rallies across Armenian cities.""Our republic has been betrayed!"" they add.Under the terms of the ceasefire, the Armenian army completely withdraws from Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijani troops remain in positions where they stopped their advance after the seizure of the stronghold of Shusha.""We could have taken Stepanakert in a few days. This is humanism on the part of our president. He did not want the military to die on either the Armenian side or the Azerbaijani side,"" said Rauf Hajiyev, an Azerbaijani resident.Then the plan is as follows – the Armenians will hand three districts over to Azerbaijan by December 1, leaving only the so-called Lachin corridor. A narrow, 5 km wide corridor, which connects Stepanakert with Armenia. But there is another ""winner's bonus"": a direct road from Azerbaijan to the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic will be built along the territory of Armenia. It is part of Azerbaijan, but was cut off from Armenia.Russia, realizing that its influence in the Caucasus was melting right in front of its eyes, quickly took the last chance to stay.""A Russian peacekeeping contingent will be deployed along the demarcation line in Nagorno-Karabakh and along the corridor connecting Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia,"" said Russian President Vladimir Putin.Now Russian convoys with the relevant inscriptions saying ""peacekeeping forces"" are moving to Stepanakert. Nearly 2,000 Russian soldiers are to set up observation posts where the Azerbaijani army stopped their advance earlier this week.It is interesting that TSN.Tyzhden meets ""old acquaintances"" sporting peacekeeping helmets: the 15th separate brigade of the Russian armed forces, whose soldiers have repeatedly been involved in hostilities in the Ukrainian Donbas.""Our team has undergone special training. It consists only of professionals who are ready to perform any tasks,"" said Oleksiy Butenko, a serviceman with the 15th Brigade of the Russian armed forces.But Turkey has once again curtailed Putin's appetites. Ankara is also sending its peacekeepers to Karabakh.According to the agreement, in five years Azerbaijan has the right to expel the Russians from Karabakh. The Turks, however, are welcome to stay. Before our eyes, a new geopolitical configuration is being set up in the region.""Turkey supports us. Because the Turks and we are one people. One nation,"" a resident of the frontline town of Terter, Ahad Sultanov, tells TSN.Tyzhden.Ukrainians are also referred to as allies here. People here do understand that thirty years ago Azerbaijan was in the same situation that Ukraine is in today.So the locals assure: ""It will be even better for you. And Crimea will eventually be back.""Even before the ceasefire, blue-yellow colors could be seen in the front line zone.When asked by TSN.Tyzhnya why there is a Ukrainian flag hoisted among the flags of Israel, Pakistan and Turkey at one of the restaurants, Rauf Hajiyev, the owner's husband, says: ""These are the flags of our allies, our friends. Ukraine has always been a fraternal country for us. We will share our experience and I think that the Ukrainian state will restore its sovereign borders, starting with Crimea and ending with Donbas.""Karabakh could actually become a mirror in which Ukraine will see itself and its future – how it could also regain the territories that are now being temporarily occupied.""Today should show whether the Nagorno-Karabakh agreements are viable at all. After all, today, by the end of the day, the Armenian army must hand over to Azerbaijan, without a fight, control over the largest area of ​​the so-called Nagorno-Karabakh Republic,"" TSN.Tyzhnden's special correspondent Andriy Tsaplienko reports from the ground.Now there is a stench of dozens of fires hanging over the area. The war has stopped, but civilian homes keep bursting into flames. It's homeowners who set them on fire in a bid not to leave their belongings to the enemy.""In the end, we will burn everything down so that Muslims get nothing,"" some Armenian say.""We are leaving behind this empty land,"" locals add.Who will come to this land now? How many Azerbaijani refugees who fled their homes thirty years ago will be able to return to their native villages?""Azerbaijan has paid a very high price for its victory. This is a village built for refugees from Karabakh. Not far from the front line. For all forty-four days of the Caucasus War, it was under artillery fire. The last shelling ended only once the ceasefire agreement was signed by parties to the conflict,"" Andriy Tsaplienko says, showing on camera the devastated civilian neighborhoods.Refugees will have to return to where the shells were literally falling on them just yesterday. And these people know – there is scorched earth they'll see there.Adalat Atayev, a refugee from Karabakh, believes that peaceful Armenians who will remain in these territories will be able to live along with Azerbaijanis: ""Everything will be fine. Azerbaijanis are, in fact, very peaceful people.""However, it remains to be seen how long it will take for both nations to forgive each other for the bloody war.""No, it will be an issue to forgive as we saw their hostility towards us, I don't think it'll work… You see, I was six when we were expelled from our village. I was as old as this child I'm holding now,"" says Magira Mehramova, a refugee from Karabakh, who talks to a reporter with a girl in her arms.Many years are probably still to pass before this hot spot eventually cools down. And before an ultimate reconciliation in Black Garden (that's how Karabakh translates) this little girl will probably have started her own family.";A
UA;Armenia surrender. Who's the main beneficiary of Karabakh truce?;"The latest developments around Nagorno-Karabakh were predictable and logical – in terms of behavior of both Turkey and Russia. Indeed, the Azerbaijani-Armenian war was in fact about the Turkey-Russia confrontation.Turkey ultimately won, having received for the first time in 75 years, since World War 2, the opportunity to influence the political situation in the South CaucasusRussians believe they won. However, in reality, this isn't the case. It's Turkey who ultimately won, having received for the first time in 75 years, since World War 2, the opportunity to influence the political situation in the South Caucasus. This is Turkey's main achievement. Moscow also prefers to not comment on the fact that Turkish observers will keep an eye on Russian peacekeepers in Karabakh.Anyway, Nagorno-Karabakh is returning under Azerbaijan's jurisdiction. At the same time, Russia maintains good relations with Azerbaijan as the Kremlin did not intervene in the conflict at this stage. Massively weakened both politically and militarily, Armenia will be forced to ""bow down"" to Russia begging for salvation, and the latter is likely to show some love in capacity of an ""elder sister."" And all political blame for the surrender will of course be put on Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan. In fact, Pashinyan has already taken all blame upon himself. Therefore, most likely, a change in the political leadership is imminent, and Moscow will surely try to plant a loyal successor, pushing for the return to power of Sargsyan's party, the so-called ""party of war."" At the same time, Russia will get yet another enclave, this time in the shape of an entire Armenia, where it will strengthen its military presence, deploying more troops, as well as further determine Armenia's foreign and domestic policies.Turkey gets a land corridor to Azerbaijan, which no one will controlHowever, Turkey will still receive the greatest preferences. Despite the fact that the Russian peacekeeping contingent will be stationed in Nagorno-Karabakh, it will stay within its borders. The Lachin corridor is only 5 km wide. The number of peacekeepers and hardware is clearly regulated: 1,920 soldiers, 90 armored personnel carriers, and 380 vehicles. These forces pose no major military threat to Azerbaijan. The financial costs of maintaining the peacekeeping contingent, however, shall be borne by Russia. They will also have to fund construction of a new bypass road around Shusha, as well as restore Armenian economy, affected by military measures, primarily, mobilization. All this will be Russian money.Turkey could use this land corridor, among other things, for laying oil and gas pipes from Central AsiaSo what Russia got is yet another ""headache.""At the same time, Turkey receives a land corridor to Azerbaijan, which no one will control. Russia will be responsible for ensuring security of this corridor: Russian border guards will be obliged to protect the area from provocations. I suggest Turkey will ultimately use this land corridor, including for laying oil and gas pipes from Central Asia running via Azerbaijan to Turkey. This is Erdogan's old strategy of turning Turkey into a southern gas and oil hub. Not only is Erdogan resolving the issue by bypassing the Russian territory – Russians will also have to guard the corridor... In the meantime, Turkish observers will closely monitor the way Russia fulfills its obligations in terms of ensuring peace in the region.So no matter how long that Armenia prepares for a revanche, but as long as there are Russian peacekeepers there, Yerevan's dream of returning Nagorno-Karabakh by force will be impossible to realize.But why did Russia ""surrender"" Armenia? First, Pashinyan didn't come to power at Putin's behest. Pashinyan is a protégé of Gazprom. Putin's man is Serzh Sargsyan, representing the so-called Karabakh Clan.Russia, apparently, decided to ""kill all birds with one stone""Secondly, the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh was at an impasse. Over the past couple of years, Ilham Aliyev, with Turkey's support, had increasingly been demanding from Russia a clear ""road map"" for Azerbaijan to regain control of Nagorno-Karabakh. The first alarm bell rang in 2016 when a ""four-day war"" erupted, but Armenia did not draw no conclusions whatsoever.So, Russia, apparently, decided to ""kill all birds with one stone"": to maintain good relations with Azerbaijan, allowing them to conquer Karabakh, to retain normal ties with Turkey, to get a weakened Armenia in order to deploy troops there, i.e. to strengthen own military presence. Also, Russia got the opportunity to ensure the change in Armenia's political leadership.Russians forgot the most important thing: Turks will now monitor them closelyHowever, everything turned out as in Dante's Divine Comedy, when God told who would watch out for whom. So, the Russians forgot the most important thing: Turks will now monitor them closely. So who is the main beneficiary of this whole campaign then? It's Turkey and Azerbaijan.In fact, Turkey, with the hands of the Russian Federation, will henceforth be in control of the situation in the South Caucasus.";A

These are new realities that are now part of the international everyday life, and I think that this is a political precedent that will be an inspiring example for all countries where there are frozen conflicts, and this will oblige international mediators and leaders of international organizations to be more sensitive and more clear and principled about such conflicts, "" Akhundova said.As was reported earlier, Armenia and Azerbaijan resumed hostilities in Nagorno-Karabakh on the morning of September 27, mutually accusing each other of shelling border areas and provoking violence. Both countries declared martial law and mobilization. The fighting has already resulted in military losses on both sides and numerous civilian casualties.Ukraine called on the parties to the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh not to stir up additional emotions and to settle the conflict in compliance with the principle of the territorial integrity of states.The conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh began in 1988. In 1994, after six years of war, the sides signed the Bishkek Protocol according to which Azerbaijan and Armenia agreed on a ceasefire.

UK;Armenia-Azerbaijan: Why did Nagorno-Karabakh spark a conflict?;"A peace deal has been agreed between Armenia and Azerbaijan, two former Soviet Union republics in the Caucasus region.It brings to an end six weeks of fierce fighting in which thousands of people were reported killed and many more displaced.At the heart of the conflict was the Nagorno-Karabakh region. It is recognised as part of Azerbaijan, but it is controlled by ethnic Armenians.The two countries fought a bloody war over the region in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and it has been the trigger for further violence in the years since.The story in 100 wordNagorno-Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan, but its population is majority Armenian. As the Soviet Union saw increasing tensions in its constituent republics in the 1980s, Nagorno-Karabakh voted to become part of Armenia - sparking a war that stopped with a ceasefire in 1994.Since then, Nagorno-Karabakh has remained part of Azerbaijan but is controlled by separatist ethnic Armenians backed by the Armenian government. Until recently, negotiations mediated by international powers had failed to deliver a peace agreement.Armenia is majority Christian while Azerbaijan is majority Muslim. Turkey has close ties to Azerbaijan, while Russia is allied with Armenia - although it also has good relations with Azerbaijan.The story in 600 wordsThe Caucasus is a strategically important mountainous region in south-east Europe. For centuries, different powers in the region - both Christian and Muslim - have vied for control there.Modern-day Armenia and Azerbaijan became part of the Soviet Union when it formed in the 1920s. Nagorno-Karabakh was an ethnic-majority Armenian region, but the Soviets gave control over the area to Azerbaijani authorities.It was only as the Soviet Union began to collapse in the late 1980s that Nagorno-Karabakh's regional parliament officially voted to become part of Armenia.Azerbaijan sought to suppress the separatist movement, while Armenia backed it. This led to ethnic clashes, and - after Armenia and Azerbaijan declared independence from Moscow - a full-scale war.Tens of thousands died and up to a million were displaced amid reports of ethnic cleansing and massacres committed by both sides. Most of those displaced in the war were Azerbaijanis.Armenian forces gained control of Nagorno-Karabakh and areas adjacent to it before a Russian-brokered ceasefire was declared in 1994.After that deal, Nagorno-Karabakh remained part of Azerbaijan, but since then has mostly been governed by a separatist, self-declared republic, run by ethnic Armenians and backed by the Armenian government.It also established the Nagorno-Karabakh Line of Contact, separating Armenian and Azerbaijan forces.Peace talks have taken place since then, mediated by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group - a body set up in 1992 and chaired by France, Russia and the United States.But clashes continued, and a serious flare-up in 2016 saw the deaths of dozens of troops on both sides.The conflict is further complicated by geopolitics. Nato member-state Turkey was the first nation to recognise Azerbaijan's independence in 1991. Former Azeri President Heydar Aliyev once described the two as ""one nation with two states"". Both share a Turkic culture and populations.Moreover, Turkey has no official relations with Armenia. In 1993 Turkey shut its border with Armenia in support of Azerbaijan during the war over Nagorno-Karabakh.Armenia meanwhile has had good relations with Russia. There is a Russian military base in Armenia, and both are members of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) military alliance. However, President Vladimir Putin also has maintained good relations with Azerbaijan.In 2018, Armenia underwent a peaceful revolution, sweeping long-time ruler Serzh Sargsyan from power. Protest leader Nikol Pashinyan became the prime minister after free elections that year.Mr Pashinyan agreed with Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev to de-escalate tensions and set up the first military hotline between the two countries.But in August 2019 Mr Pashinyan told crowds of ethnic Armenians assembled in the main city in Karabakh, Stepanakert, that ""Artsakh is Armenia, full stop."" Artsakh is the Armenian name for Karabakh. The remarks angered Azerbaijan and were repeatedly condemned by President Aliyev.Fighting broke out in July this year on the international border between Armenia and Azerbaijan, some 300km (185 miles) away from Nagorno-Karabakh. By the end of the month Turkey's military was taking part in large-scale joint exercises in Azerbaijan.The latest conflict broke out on 27 September. Armenia said Azerbaijan fired the first shots. Azerbaijan said it was launching a ""counter-offensive"" in response to Armenian aggression.Fighting came to an end in November when both sides agreed to sign a Russian-brokered peace deal. Under its terms, Azerbaijan holds on to several areas that it gained control of during the conflict and Armenia will withdraw troops from them. Almost 2,000 Russian peacekeepers will monitor the truce.";A
UK;Nagorno-Karabakh: Azerbaijan 'takes key town' in Armenia conflict;"Azerbaijan has taken a key town in the separatist Nagorno-Karabakh region, according to the country's president.Ilham Aliyev announced in a televised address on Sunday that Azerbaijani forces had gained control of Shusha, known as Shushi in Armenian.Armenia, however, denied the town's loss and said fighting was ongoing.Taking the strategically important town would be a major victory for Azerbaijan in the ongoing conflict over the disputed territory.Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, but is governed by ethnic Armenians backed by the Armenian government.A war between the two countries over the region ended in 1994 with a truce but no peace deal.Fresh fighting erupted in September, with each side blaming the other for the outbreak in violence.What's the latest on the ground?Shusha sits on hills above the territory's capital Stepanakert (known as Khankendi in Azerbaijan) and lies on the road linking the city with Armenian territory. If taken, it could serve as a staging post for an assault on the capital.President Aliyev said the ""liberation"" of Shusha would ""go down in the history of the Azerbaijani people"".""There is no force in the world that can stop us,"" he said, pledging to retake Nagorno-Karabakh for his country.In an interview made before the latest developments from Shusha, Mr Aliyev told the BBC's Orla Guerin said Armenia was running out of time.""Their opportunities to compromise are shrinking because we are getting those territories back by force,"" he said.Azerbaijan has been steadily advancing into Nagorno-Karabakh in recent weeks, as a BBC map from 27 October shows.Armenia, however, has denied the town has been taken by Azerbaijan. ""The battles in Shushi continue - wait and believe in our troops,"" Armenian defence ministry official Artsrun Hovhannisyan wrote on Facebook.And David Babayan, a foreign policy adviser to Nagorno-Karabakh's self-declared president Arayik Harutyunyan, told the BBC: ""We can say that Shushi is a battlefield and there are Azeri troops and Karabakh troops there, fighting each other for every building.""Before Azerbaijan's announcement, Armenian defence ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan wrote that ""the most ferocious combat"" had taken place around Shusha overnight.She said a number of Azerbaijani soldiers, tanks and other vehicles had been destroyed in the fighting.Disinformation spreads amid Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict'Execution' video prompts Karabakh war crime probeShusha has cultural significance for both sides. Its population was predominantly Azerbaijani before the war in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which forced hundreds of thousands to flee.For Armenians it is the home of the Ghazanchetsots (Holy Saviour) Cathedral, an iconic site for the Armenian Apostolic Church. Armenia accused Azerbaijan of targeting the building last month.Both sides deny targeting civilians but accuse the other of doing so.It is unclear exactly how many have died. Nagorno-Karabakh's authorities say nearly 1,200 of its defence forces have died in the fighting, and civilians have also been killed or injured.Azerbaijan has not released its military casualty figures but has said more than 80 civilians have been killed in the fighting - including 21 in a missile strike on the town of Barda last month.Russian President Vladimir Putin said last month that almost 5,000 people had been killed in the fighting.What's been the reaction?People poured onto the streets of the Azerbaijani capital Baku in celebration, honking car horns, chanting slogans and waving the national flag.Reuters news agency reports that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has congratulated ""my Azeri brothers"", telling a crowd in Turkey's Kocaeli province that he thought what was happening in Shusha was ""a sign that the rest of the occupied lands will be liberated soon too"".Azerbaijan is an ally of Turkey's, and Mr Erdogan has pledged his nation's total support for Azerbaijan in the conflict.On Saturday the Turkish president told his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin that Armenia must withdraw from Azerbaijan's land and ""must be convinced to sit down at the negotiating table"".A statement from the Kremlin said Mr Putin had told Mr Erdogan that he had spoken to leaders from both Armenia and Azerbaijan, focusing on ""finding options for a swift cessation of hostilities and a political and diplomatic settlement"".International powers have made repeated attempts to broker a ceasefire in recent weeks.Russia - which is allied to Armenia but has close ties to Azerbaijan - negotiated two truces last month which were both broken almost immediately, while both sides accused the other of violating a US-brokered ceasefire announced on 25 October within minutes of it coming into force.";N
UK;Viewpoint: Russia and Turkey - unlikely victors of Karabakh conflict;A bloody six-week war in Nagorno-Karabakh is over, after a peace agreement brokered by Moscow was signed by the leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia. As the dust settles, Azerbaijan appears to be the clear winner, while Armenia has suffered a bitter defeat. There are, however, two other powers that have benefited from the conflict and the resolution effort: Turkey and Russia.How Turkey and Russia have gained from conflictFor Turkey, the war in Karabakh was a showcase for Ankara's growing role in the strategically important South Caucasus.The victorious Azerbaijani military was supplied, trained, and supported by the Turkish army. Some reports suggest that Turkish officers played a key part in guiding drone attacks which played a decisive role in this conflict, although that has been denied by Ankara.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was also vocal in his diplomatic support for Azerbaijan. The victory shows that Turkey has gained significant influence in the region, particularly in Turkic Azerbaijan.At the same time, the outcome of this war, and particularly the way the peace agreement came about, is a win for Russia.Just a couple of weeks ago, with significant Azeri advances and videos of modern drones destroying Armenian Soviet-era tanks, Moscow's position looked pitiable. A great power that was once the unchallenged regional hegemon appeared unable to save Armenia, its only treaty ally in the South Caucasus.But Russian calculations turned out to be more sophisticated and nuanced.Why Russia left Armenia on its ownOver the last two decades, the Kremlin has been under no illusions that, with a petrodollar-fuelled Azeri defence budget three times the size of Armenia's, the balance of power has been inexorably tilting towards Azerbaijan. Moscow tried to pressure Armenia to accept a diplomatic settlement brokered by Russia, the US and France, but the Armenian side refused to make concessions.When a democratic revolution in Armenia brought Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan to power in 2018, Yerevan's public stance on Nagorno-Karabakh became even tougher.This is why for years Russia has made it clear to the Armenian government that the military treaty between Yerevan and Moscow covers only the internationally recognised territory of Armenia, and not Karabakh. When the Azeri onslaught began, Armenia was on its own.How Russia benefits from peace dealWhen the Azeri military had taken Shusha (Shushi in Armenian), the second-largest city in Karabakh, Russian diplomatic efforts intensified. Using a mixture of diplomacy and pressure, Moscow secured a peace deal that turns a conflict in which there were no good options for the Kremlin into a situation that helped to boost Russia's leverage.The deal has prevented the conclusive defeat of Nagorno-Karabakh and the likely expulsion of its Armenian inhabitants.Russia is sending about 2,000 peacekeepers to protect the remaining Armenian population, separate the two adversaries, and patrol a corridor that will connect Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh: something the Kremlin has wanted since 1994, but couldn't obtain at the negotiating table before this war.Moscow has also managed to sideline Ankara.Russian President Vladimir Putin is the only signatory of the peace deal beyond the leaders of the two warring states, and the Russian troops will be the only peacekeepers monitoring the implementation of the agreement, with no Turkish or any other boots on the ground - although Turkey says it will send observers.Russian border and customs services will control and operate a newly created route that will connect Azerbaijan with its exclave of Nakhichevan.Finally, Moscow has shown that it remains an indispensable power in the region, and was able to preserve its ties with both Azerbaijan and Armenia, while successfully competing with Turkey.Why Russia has not had complete successMoscow's diplomatic victory comes at a price. The war has shown the growth of Turkish influence in the Caucasus, and Moscow no longer looks like the only major power in the region.But the region had been opening up over the three decades since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and no-one in Moscow believed Russia could dominate the region indefinitely.Then there is the anger and sense of betrayal felt by Armenian society.But Moscow believes Yerevan has no realistic options other than continuing to rely on Russia to guarantee its security. A likely by-product of the Armenian defeat might be the fall of Nikol Pashinyan's government, but he won't be missed by the Kremlin.Why risks lie aheadThe major risk for Russia going forward is the precariousness of the peace deal that Moscow has brokered.The treaty securing the presence of Russian peacekeepers will expire in five years, after which both Azerbaijan and Armenia will be in a position to call for their withdrawal.The window of opportunity to broker a resolution to the conflict is very narrow, and, given the emotions on both sides and shattered status quo, getting Baku and Yerevan to agree on anything looks like an impossible mission.This might be the point when Moscow will need co-operation from the US and Europe, which - having been completely absent from the picture this time around - can for the moment also be seen as in the losers' camp.;N
UK;Nagorno-Karabakh: Civilians hit amid Armenia Azerbaijan conflict;"Armenia and Azerbaijan have accused each other of attacking residential areas as the conflict over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region rages on.Azerbaijan said an Armenian missile had killed at least 13 civilians in Ganja, a city far from the front lines.Armenia meanwhile accused Azerbaijan of shelling residences in Stepanakert.It is the capital of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but run by ethnic Armenians.A six-year war over the territory ended in 1994 with a ceasefire but not a peace treaty.What are Armenia and Azerbaijan fighting over?Karabakh war leaves civilians shell-shocked and bitterNagorno-Karabakh conflict in picturesFighting flared last month and has killed hundreds of people. Both sides signed a Russian-brokered truce last weekend, but the conflict has continued.What happened overnight?Officials in Azerbaijan announced on Saturday that at least 13 people had been killed and more than 40 injured after a missile struck populated areas in Ganja, the second-largest city in the country.About 100 rescuers are working to reach people believed to be trapped under the rubble, BBC Azeri reported.A foreign ministry statement accused Armenia of ""deliberate and indiscriminate targeting of civilians"".Armenian officials denied the attack, and accused Azerbaijan of attacking civilian areas.Defence ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan posted a video on Facebook which she said showed devastation in the Nagorno-Karabakh region.""At night, once again violating the humanitarian ceasefire, the Azerbaijani Armed Force struck with missiles at [civilians]... including the capital Stepanakert.""What's the latest on the ground?In a televised address on Saturday, Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev denied attacking civilians while accusing Armenia of destroying or damaging ""more than 2,000 houses"" in Azerbaijan.He also said that his country's forces had taken the city of Fuzuli and seven villages in Nagorno-Karabakh.""Our revenge is on the battlefield,"" he said. ""The Azerbaijani army is achieving its goal, no force can stop us.""On Thursday, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said his country had suffered ""numerous casualties"" on the battlefield, but added that despite ""losses of manpower and equipment"", Armenian forces were still in general control and had inflicted ""numerous losses of manpower and equipment on the enemy"".""This is not a statement of despair or desperation. I provide this information because I am committed to tell our people the truth,"" he said.";A
UK;Nagorno-Karabakh conflict: Missile strike on Azeri town kills 21 civilians;"Azerbaijan has accused the Armenian military of killing at least 21 civilians in a missile strike as fighting over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh intensifies.Dozens more were reportedly wounded in the strike on the Azeri town of Barda, not far from the ongoing clashes.Armenia has denied carrying out the attack, and accused Azerbaijan of targeting a maternity ward in the area.Fighting over the region of Nagorno-Karabakh erupted on 27 September.The mountainous territory is officially part of Azerbaijan, but run by ethnic Armenians.What happened in the latest strikes?Azerbaijani presidential spokesman Hikmet Hajiyev said Armenian forces had ""used cluster munitions to inflict excessive casualties among civilians"" in Barda, in central Azerbaijan.Images posted on social media showed damage to streets and vehicles with what appeared to be several bodies in body bags laid out on the road.What are Armenia and Azerbaijan fighting over?One local resident, Ulviyya Babayeva, said she was in her car nearby when she heard three explosions and decided to head to the area.""We saw a fire... bombs have been dropped,"" she told the BBC. ""One fell on the car outside a bank building, fragments [of bombs] everywhere, [broken] glass [of cars/windows]... one of the bombs fell outside fire rescue station, there are dead and injured people.""Police officers and other service personnel were sent to Barda to help transport the injured to hospital, as well as provide additional security in the town, the Azerbaijani interior ministry said.The ministry added that the attack was a gross violation of international humanitarian law, and that the Armenian government should accept responsibility.Separately, a statement issued by Karabkah officials said Azerbaijani forces had struck a maternity hospital and other ""civil infrastructure"" in the territory's city of Stepanakert.They added that information on possible casualties at the facility, which had been under construction, was ""being clarified"".The latest attacks come just days after a US-brokered ceasefire was agreed between the two sides.Earlier, Azerbaijani media reported that the head of the Nagorno-Karabakh military, Jalal Harutyunyan, was killed in a special operation on Tuesday.The Azerbaijani defence ministry said that Mr Harutyunyan, who it accused of carrying out war crimes in the region, was identified by surveillance teams entering a vehicle, which was then targeted by a drone strike.What about the ceasefire?The US-brokered ceasefire, the third relating to the recent conflict after two previous agreements brokered by Russia failed, began early on Monday.US President Donald Trump tweeted shortly after it was announced by the US state department at the weekend to congratulate those involved following ""intense negotiations"".But just minutes after it came into force, Armenia and Azerbaijan both accused each other of violating the truce.Azerbaijan said Armenian forces began shelling the town of Terter and nearby villages in a ""gross violation"" of the agreement.Armenia's defence ministry said Azerbaijani artillery had fired on military positions in various parts of the front line after the ceasefire agreement had begun.Clashes that began in the region in September have quickly escalated into a large-scale conflict, with the shelling of towns and cities and the alleged use of banned cluster munitions.Several thousand people have died and shelling has killed civilians on both sides. Tens of thousands have fled their homes.";A

VA;Pope renews his appeal for peace in the Caucasus;"Pope Francis issued a heartfelt appeal on Sunday for an end to the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan that, he said, is causing much death and suffering.Speaking after the Angelus prayer in St. Peter’s Square on the Solemnity of All Saints’, the Pope said “during these feast days, let us not forget  what is happeninig in Nagorno Karabakh, where armed clashes are interrupted intermittently by fragile truces.”He decried a “tragic increase in the number of victims, the destruction of homes, infrastructures and places of worship,” and noted that civilians are increasingly under attack.Appeal to authorities and international community“I would like to renew my heartfelt appeal to the parties responsible in the conflict so that they intervene as soon as possible to stop the shedding of innocent blood"", the Pope said, urging them not to attempt to solve the controversy with violence, but engaging in ""sincere negotiations with the help of the international community.”Pope Francis said he is close to all those who are suffering, and he invited them to pray to All Saints for a stable peace in the region.    The Pope has already expressed his concern and appealed for a negotiated solution to the crisis in Nagorno Karabakh during the Angelus on 28 September.Mutual accusationsMeanwhile, on the ground Armenia and Azerbaijan have again accused each other of bombing residential areas in defiance of a pact to avoid the deliberate targeting of civilians in and around disputed Nagorno-Karabakh.Shelling was reported by both sides on Saturday within hours of the latest agreement to defuse the conflict, reached after talks in Geneva between the two countries’ foreign ministers and envoys from France, Russia and the United States.The death toll in the worst fighting in the South Caucasus for more than 25 years has surpassed 1,000.";N
VA;Armenia and Azerbaijan accuse each other of violating latest ceasefire;"New clashes were reported between Azerbaijan and Armenia just hours after the US President had proudly announced on social networking site Twitter that his team managed to negotiate a ceasefire between the warring Caucasus nations.  The US-brokered truce was a third attempt to establish a lasting ceasefire in the flare-up of a decades-old conflict over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. Two previous Russia-brokered agreements, including one last weekend, collapsed immediately after taking force, with both sides blaming each other for violations.The new ceasefire was also challenged quickly by accusations from both sides. Azerbaijani Defense Ministry alleged that Armenian forces fired at Azerbaijani settlements and the positions of the Azerbaijani army. It said attacks happened ""along the entire front, as well as on the Armenia-Azerbaijan state border"" and involved various small arms, mortars, and howitzers.Armenian denial Armenian military officials rejected the accusations and accused Azerbaijani forces of shelling the northeastern area of Nagorno-Karabakh and other regions. Local authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh also charged that Azerbaijan targeted the town of Martuni with military aviation. Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry denied it violated the ceasefire agreement. Amongst the population in Nagorno-Karabakh, there are Christian and Catholic communities including one that worships in the 19th-century Armenian Apostolic cathedral in the town of Shusha. The Holy Saviour Cathedral, also known as Ghazanchetsots, was heavily damaged in recent shelling, allegedly by Azerbaijan's forces. But priests there can still be seen ringing the bells and praying for the victims and for peace inside the damaged church. 'Prayers reaching God'""It doesn't matter if these prayers come from basements, houses, or churches - all prayers reach God,"" said Armenian priest Andreas Tavadyan. ""To be honest, there are far more dangerous places in Artsakh [the Armenian name for Nagorno-Karabakh]. There is a front line which is really dangerous. But this is our front line: we have to fight the evil, we pray. It's our [spiritual] battlefield."" He added: ""I believe this danger is not that important for us. No matter if we see that the cathedral is damaged, we know God is in all of our prayers. God will save us."" Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan, a mainly Muslim nation, but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia, which is primarily Christian, since a war there ended in 1994. The latest fighting that began on September 27 has involved heavy artillery, rockets, and drones. The violence has officially killed more than 1,000 people in the largest escalation of hostilities over the separatist region in more than a quarter-century.Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week that Moscow's information suggests the death toll from the fighting was nearing 5,000, significantly higher than what both sides report.";N
