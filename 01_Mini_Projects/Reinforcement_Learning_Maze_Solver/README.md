# Maze Solver With Reinforcement Learning

## Q-Learning

As the main algorithm, we have used the [Q-Learning](https://www.learndatasci.com/tutorials/reinforcement-q-learning-scratch-python-openai-gym/).


## SARSA (State Action Reward State)

[SARSA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sarsa-reinforcement-learning/) is a kind of variation of the Q-Learning method.

## Hyperparameter Optimization

We have used [Genetic Algorithm](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-optimization-with-genetic-algorithm-2f5001d9964b)s in order to find better hyperparameters.
